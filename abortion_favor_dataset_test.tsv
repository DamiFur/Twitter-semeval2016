I am calling on my RN and NP colleagues to join me in asking @AlbertaRNs to issue a public statement opposing the harmful Bill 207 , which if enacted , will impact access to healthcare services such as abortion , MAID , and LGBTQ 2S + services . #Bill207 #AbLeg @shandro @DShepYEG https://t.co/gxVlYv0u5W

This is 100 % an attack on reproductive rights , medical assistance in dying , and queer and trans health access . It is not an undue hardship to have to refer . Patients have rights to care that doctors should not be allowed to simply deny . https://t.co/gCKfHREaGG

Good piece on how the work we ’ re doing here in Virginia to #FlipVABlue will help us pass a lot of progressive legislation including codifying Roe into law and repealing anti choice laws . https://t.co/6xAdc8L9o6
This would restrict more than reproductive rights , it would allow a Dr . to any treatment on the grounds is conscientious objection.This is the road to Theocracy & must be stopped ! #abpoli #ableg https://t.co/x3ze3owYsP

@people @WHO @nasem @Guttmacher @AbortionFunds @aidaccess @Plancpills @WomenHelpOrg The combination of this misinformation is especially dangerous since it suggests that medication abortion is expensive & there's no help ( false ) and that you can't turn to the internet to access abortion pills ( false ) .

@people @WHO @nasem @Guttmacher @AbortionFunds @aidaccess @Plancpills @WomenHelpOrg She also only names Planned Parenthood as a provider . Independent clinics before the vast majority of abortions in the US - worth it to call them for care , too !

#liarrose spreading more lies . Not every bill passed relates to abortion . Nor is abortion legal through nine months or tax funded . Lying is a sin don ’ t you know Lila ?

The argument doesn't even make any sense . Lots of good things aren't free . Prenatal care & delivery - a good path for some people - is costly . Would be great if all pregnancy options were free , & we continue to try to make them more affordable & accessible . #prochoice https://t.co/y46ovYN5gM
#prolife won ’ t stop at abortion , but until all birth control is banned . All major prolife groups believe that BC is a form of abortion and either refuse to provide it , lie about it or are trying to ban it . It ’ s further proof that they only want to control women . #prochoice https://t.co/Z9QcJsb8XA

@lookschinese19 @Stacy_g52 @MadamS8N @ladyasterianox Yet you oppose legal abortion precisely because of your religious interpretation which tells you women who don't want to pregnant deserve to die during childbirth / unsafe abortion rather than be able to remove an embryo .
@lookschinese19 @Stacy_g52 @MadamS8N @ladyasterianox I don't have to attack religion to argue that criminalized abortion is a bad thing . Many religious people already support abortion rights . The public health data does the arguing for me .
@people @WHO @nasem @Guttmacher @AbortionFunds @aidaccess @Plancpills @WomenHelpOrg She ends the article repeating the stigmatizing phrase , " no woman wants to get an abortion . " First of all , not everyone who gets pregnant is a woman . Second , many people * want * abortions once they find out they're pregnant . Please don't make moral judgments about your patients .

Yes . Collins losing LCV endorsement isn't by itself of huge consequence .
