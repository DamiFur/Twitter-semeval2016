@sweatShawp If abortion was outlawed , then maybe the original purpose of sex can finally be realized and people will think before they act .
@PotatoFarmUSA @AJWTheology @DouglasKMurray I believe it was Madeleine Albright who first said it ( as a feminist in relation to HRC ) . When I hear it re-used , it's usually a retort against progressive policies on abortion or someone's virtue signalling that in reality does harm .

An easy solution for men in my timeline who say they are adamant about stopping abortion is to never have sex with a woman unless she wants to get pregnant . Unplanned pregnancies don ‚Äô t happen without your sperm . It ‚Äô ll save you the trouble of telling women to ‚Äú shut their legs . ‚Äù

Someone from the Pro Life movement once told me that he wished that there were scans to detect if the fetus was gay , and that if it was gay he would make his wife terminate because he was not having a gay child . The hypocrisy is unreal !
@ChrisReagan16 Take the libertarian party message , and add securing the border , and banning abortion . That is the stance of most of the areas that trump won in 2016 , and will again in 2020 . Those 2 big issues are why so many vote republican , and why so many refuse to support the LP .

@krazysh0t @BasedElisabeth @cenkuygur The problem is American liberals view abortion as some kind of moral good / woman ‚Äô s liberation when in fact it ‚Äô s human life at its most innocent and vulnerable being destroyed .
What the fuck ? 1 ) Life begins at conception . 2 ) Abortion meets the legal definition of murder but its legal so it ‚Äô s not murder . 3 ) I oppose abortion . 4 ) I advocate avoiding pregnancy by taking your health and safety seriously . 5 ) There are options besides abortion .

@SissGugu @KhumiHamese The abortion stigma should be removed but having an abortion has physical , emotional and spiritual consequences and no women should be FORCED to abort . A man must use a condom if he does not want a baby .

@AbbyJohnson Of course that's the take you get from the sign and not the true meaning ! For everyone , who didn't get the meaning behind it : " even on my worse days , I'M AMAZING ! " But you'll only believe , what feeds into your believes . And BTW , abortion is women's health care !

@ninetyfeetaway @misamaokinawa @epiphanyplanter @JLPtalk Libertarians aren't necessarily for abortion , nor are they necessarily for gay marriage ( in fact they tend to be against the state being involved in marriage , thereby being specifically anti-gay marriage ) , and being against open borders is something everyone used to be against .

@EmmaJackson57 Abortion is a right , but this is an unhelpfully simplistic take .

Absolutely ! They don't really care . It is a convenient talking point used when controversy or a diversion from the narrative is necessary .

@JT_Huck @LilaGraceRose God & the Bible are NOT pro-life , the Bible is ok w / a test causing abortion if performed by priest to determine if a woman did adultery .

@ksserendipity @CritFlaild20 @StupidRock @AmyAddante Unless the woman is dying , abortion is not self defense .
What we are encountering now is the apostatizing of Christianity . A man who was once pro-choice now claims to be pro-life yet his behavior is antithetical to Christianity . His deception condemns rather than saves ( See Mt . 25:31- 46 & 2Thes . 2:1- 17 ) not only creating the image

@ZubyMusic The glaring impediment on both sides of the abortion discussion is the incredibly useful fiction that all lives are of equal value in all situations . It's a heavy lifter as social heuristics go , but severely impedes reason in this context .

@gb4bedfordfalls @NBCNews 3 . The biggest part is to do no harm , and specifically no " wrong-doing " . Clearly that is a statement dependent on morality .

@Kaile_Ashmore @PoliticalKathy Well , yes , you can be . True conservatism at its core is about freedom and the government interfering in your life as little as possible ( primarily through fiscal freedom ) .

@TerryMcAuliffe When does the gun grabbing , unlimited abortion , high taxes and socialism start ? ? Asking for a friend .
@TygaRose_Roses She has always said she wants another child but when conception happens she starts getting paranoid about being a single mother . So i guess counseling even for these college pregnancies would go a long way . I believe abortion leaves emotional scars in the lady
Pro-aborts are great at either deliberately ignoring or pretending they don't understand what pro-life people believe . If Leah weren't a coward and took on our actual arguments , it wouldn't be so easy . Because no pro-lifer , EVER , has argued that pregnant women aren't people .

@Prox368 I disagree that the message is pro-choice . The abortion " theme " is present for 1-2 minutes at the end of the game mostly for shock value compared to the rest of the game which is almost completely about coming to terms with your past , mortality of loved ones , and moving on .

You can be anti-abortion , on principle , and still agree that it should be done safely rather than unsafely

@IWashington @shaunking @TheOfficerTatum This may be off subject , but even though I am pro-life , I am pro-death penalty . Unpopular .

Democrats support the evils of politics where lies are their truths , citizens are a lower class , & abortion is a form of birth control . That ‚Äô s not me .
Ditto . But then , the truth is boring , isn't it ? Cdn media requires constant conflict ( preferably with dramatic video footage ) , even if they have to manufacture it themselves . Which they're more than willing to do . @lavrys
@TheMatthewRoyer @FungeonMaster1 @daveweigel If he can woo Vietnam vets away from Trump ... that's a significant thing . They are a huge part of his base . Something tells me they don't really care as much about , say , abortion as being seen and heard and appreciated .

How is ordering a guilty verdict even possible ? Doesn't that run against the whole point of trial by jury ?
But what about someone who was raped and got pregnant ... do you think that she will want to raise that baby or let it grow inside her ? I ‚Äô m pro choice because you never know someone ‚Äô s circumstances but I couldn ‚Äô t ever get an abortion myself .

@DebbieWarden10 @getoveritlibs @jerseycornelia @PPFA I strongly doubt that is the exact wording . Please post the exact quote . In the State of California , abortion is not performed beyond the age of viability . It is not a matter of " wanted or not " . It is a matter of viability .

@SlavicLady88 And , as per the accusation against him for raping a 13 y / o , he could toss a wad of cash on her afterwards and tell her to get an abortion . His base would cheer and proclaim him to be a perfect Christian sent by God . SMFH
One of the first things I hope that Democrats do is pass @KathyKLTran ' s infanticide abortion on demand law to really stick it to " pro-life " DC Republicans who live in Virginia , like @guypbenson . I'm very much on board w / Rs having to live under policies they aided & abetted .

Of course there is an absolute , like there are with a lot of things . Physical life begins at conception and end with your last breath .
Being pro-choice doesn't equal being for or against abortion . It's simply yielding to a woman's right to choose what's best for her body . The Lord gave us free will intentionally . And judgment is his alone . Invoking his name to claim otherwise is disingenuous .

@emilyslist Planned Parenthood has made mass money aborting babies . They don't care about choice , it's all about the Benjamins . There are all kinds of birth control choices so stop ending lives .
Abortion with pills can be safe and effective , and selective targeting of medication abortion has nothing to do with public health . That ‚Äô s why we signed an expert letter with over a dozen legal and medical experts telling the FDA to stop targeting pills .
@woobie2112 No outcome is ideal in your question and based it's merit the question is not really worth answering . If you are Pro-choice .. I would suggest choosing birth control . Be a responsible human and don't just choose to end life because it's inconvenient .
