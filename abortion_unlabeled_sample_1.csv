For whatever reason , companies still think abortion is too divisive to comment on . But when the workforce is more than 50 % women , it ‚Äô s time to acknowledge that women cannot have economic equality without reproductive freedom .

Please read , print and share these with the women and MEN in your life , and maybe we can start to move the conversation forwards on women's reproductive health from one imbued with outdated ideas of morality , to one that reflects and respects women's rights over their bodies ( 10 )
I ‚Äô ve always been pro choice but having a baby has defs made me understand even more so why someone would want / need an abortion having a child is hard
@BigeatersclubOR @DragHris @matmounce @VonshelleB @AlanModracek @TheLaurenChen Abortion is a different issue . one deals with a human that was nurtured by parents that loved and wanted them . The other deals with a lump of cells that had no value to anyone and is incapable of self value .
@BrettKelman And the logical response is to ban abortion .
Dios / El esp√≠ritu santo eran pro choice . Cuando el esp√≠ritu santo se le apareci√≥ a Maria el le dijo que Dios la hab√≠a escogido a ella para cargar su hijo PERO solo si ella quer√≠a tenerlo , y ella dijo que si y ah√≠ se lo dio . NI DIOS PRE√ëO A UNA MUJER SIN SU CONSENTIMIENTO ! ! !
@bNR7B94c4gXxAD9 @agentcurieuse @NPR Oh shove off , if pro life folks really gave a shit about babies instead of swinging planned parenthood they'd support easy access to birth control or sex ed , they'd go out and adopt more unwanted children , they'd support women's health . ( 1/2 )
@Timcast Your outrage right now ... That is how those of us who oppose abortion feel about every unborn baby who is murdered inside the womb . Multiply that feeling by 60 million .
There are WAY too many pro-choice people who believe that being pro-life is a religious position & not the human rights position that it is .
@DrMichaelLBrown @AffordableREI @lancemann @R1Lillie @danzmuzik @POTUS Abortion is not murder . A fetus which can not live on its own is closer to a parasite than a baby . Don ‚Äô t get the * facts * twisted . Murder is innocent unarmed humans being killed . Abortion is not murder .

@11s_7s @FredRevived @LeahNTorres @BrokeBits I hear " if you don't like abortion , don't get one " all the time . The same could've been said about slavery . If you don't like slavery , don't own slaves . I think it's a fair comparison .
@brooksiscookin @radtoria Anti-abortion films would never be shown in any school in Canada ; Well , not any public ones , anyway , and when I was in school , public school were sorted by religion , so there were few if any " private " or charter schools here .
@Rachael_Swindon I've never understood the outrage to this video . He's quite clear . He objects to abortion under any circumstances . But acknowledges 100 % the law protects this right and he offers literally zero suggestion he would change that . You don't have to agree with his religious beliefs .

This . I am as pro-choice as the day is long . I lost my very much wanted pregnancy at 20 weeks . I held his 20 week body and sobbed over him . Being told that he isn ‚Äô t a baby is heartbreaking and makes me so angry . ‚Äú Baby ‚Äù can be a relative term . I get to decide what it means to me .

@JohnTaylorDavi2 @BlancaIsela_A @Franklin_Graham @realDonaldTrump @Nationals So I think that everyone should have the same choice . I would not choose abortion but every woman should have that choice . You do not live their lives , you do not know what best for each woman .
@alberta_fat @GlobalEdmonton @RachelNotley @jkenney You are completely entitled to your belief of never hoping to need an abortion . ( I'd hope for the same , personally ) . I can't impose my morality or choices on others for a few reasons :
@KeithH6910 @GailLedesma3 I am devout Catholic and Pro-choice , this is between me and God . This SC Catholic Church is making it between them and Biden , shame on them .
ABC killed the story IN 2016 ... what was happening in 2016 ? ? ? How many lives , children , are liberal demons willing to destroy to retain power ? Not surprised , they support abortion on demand . No Lives Matter to them
This caused a national meltdown in 1987 , but he was fearless and knew it was the right thing to do ! !

@RWPUSA It never ceases to amaze me how gullible people are and as much as a bleeding heart liberal I've been accused of I don't care , I donate first to the Red Cross and then Planned Parenthood and I will never ever get in between a woman and the relationship she has with her doctor .

@fairygodmomma @Dktr_Sus Controlling men are not necessarily prolife . .. and prolife does not mean to be against sex . I am prolife , i dont tell my daughters they should not have sex , just to make sure to choose the right man for it , make him wear condoms and on her side , contraceptives .

That is my point here . It is simply a lie to say otherwise . What about you ? Do you think abortion should be legal up to birth ?

@SusanFa31641833 @ProjectEdward_ @DToddH @FiveRights Well , your question was based on a fallacy . All Democrats are not pro-choice . And by the way , many Republicans are pro-choice . And I know that a lot of men who claim to be anti-abortion tell women to have them if it suits their purposes . You know , hypocrites .

OPINION | Andrew Scheer is effectively pro-choice , why not just own it ? : Opinion | CBC News
@Vermeullarmine I don ‚Äô t think it is so much partisan as ideological . Scalia would have voted against abortion even if the Dems became pro life and the GOP became pro abortion . The Constitution says nothing about abortion and it is not Ct ‚Äô s job to amend .

@MadSocialWerker This was mainly based on an initial tweet where you spoke with the phrase " DID / OSDD systems " where " multiples " or " plurals " would have been more appropriate ( ? ) .

@hughhowey I agree with all of this , but believe it is more than that , too . The religious right is all in on him for one reason : abortion . They forgive and ignore all his crap for that one reason . Then there are the rich wanting to get richer , with no regard for race , just money .

@sdr_medco Tribal affiliation . It ‚Äô s like how sports fans stick with their team even when the team sucks . The core underlying issue is abortion .

Why does the prochoice side STILL think we need abortion to save women ? A PREBORN BABY DOES NOT NEED TO BE INTENTIONALLY KILLED TO SAVE THE MOTHER .

@CanadaIsMyHome1 @michelinabeam @CalgaryToday @charlesadler The PCs were unmatched in losing elections ... Nobody said anything about changing abortion laws in the short-term . The debate should still happen in the public square ( outside the parties ) & when the public is convinced of the need to stop the killing , the laws will change .
@wrightdjohn @prochoiceforal1 @j_bbrav0 @SexxxtinaAqua @_alex_joshua Its abuse not to let a woman have an abortion if she wants one . Having one is simply maintaining bodily autonomy . The ZEF has no right that can force a woman to grow it till it can support itself .

@atheist_punk1 Well that is not called abortion . Aborting a child after they have grown and come out is considered murder .
@ZMockbee Might want to do your research on Bashear position on abortion . He's pro abortion , go look it up . Also , I care because Kentucky goes blue , we get more libtard Dumbocrats in congress trying to impeach POTUS and block every executive policy .

@prochoiceforal1 Some people don ‚Äô t go into planned parenthood just for abortions either . Imagine standing outside a clinic and screaming at a sixteen year old girl that she ‚Äô s a slut and a hoe and that her mama didn ‚Äô t raise her right ‚Äî when she ‚Äô s going in to get a rape kit done .

@JetLagged78 @harlemdelly @kurteichenwald @seanhannity I'll give a specific example . Bill Clinton's abortion compromise : " safe , legal and rare " . That had majority support .

@GibsonWrites Now that the USCCB has endorsed Trump in 2020 by making abortion the highest priority issue and that climate change is not a critical issue , the anti-Pope Francis mouthpiece has free range to say or do anything without challenge . Pope and faithful Catholics have been betrayed .
@no_silenced Huge taxes , Sanctuary State , Planned Parenthood and Kindergarten Transgender lessons soon all in place
This is no shock . @realDonaldTrump turned over the judiciary to The Federalist Society . Dems better make the courts a major campaign issue in 2020
@ScrapperChris @CoConator29 I do love animals . However , quite confused that same Democrats fighting to protect animals just can ‚Äô t wait to kill babies . Some even will kill baby that survives abortion .
@ShadySpotlight @JustBitchin2 @JesseKYoung1 @Ah_Science @coffeemama91 @virginia_house @TheRightColumn @KTLovesKetchup @FeministEmiIy @carissarenard @Sam_DeLoach The burning fertility clinic question is the pro-abortion equivalent of " muh roads . "
Amazing that one would accept such an award -> Nancy Pelosi Will Receive Planned Parenthood ‚Äô s Margaret Sanger Award
Killing babies is a stigma no matter how much you try to rationalize it .
@RawStory MeMe " My Father " McCain : Don't take muh guns ! But , war crimes , unfettered spying powers , and denying women their reproductive rights are perfectly fine !
More fake news , its not true that the introduction of condoms , divorce and abortion make a society better . The state of our current society compared to pre Late Late society is anything but better . Anyone I know is shocked by the disregard for human life in our country .

People , do you see how little @HouseDemocrats value human life ? Surely a society that chooses to protect animals while allowing pre & new born CHILDREN to be maimed & murdered will be laughed at , scoffed and scorned . üò¢ Babies Are Precious Abortion Is Murder

Humans begin as zygotes . A human zygote is a human . I don ‚Äô t care if you ‚Äô re pro-life or pro-choice , but to deny that a HUMAN zygote isn ‚Äô t a human is just ignorant . It ‚Äô s human no matter what stage of development it is in , if it is developing in a woman ‚Äô s womb .
@ChiuHeather Something tells me if Joe Biden had been voting against women's reproductive rights & minorities for over 25 years he would not get the same pass . Joe has always been with us women , so much so the Catholic church refused to give him communion for his abortion stance last week

@babybella666 @PPFA Meanwhile abortion is not even a right , it is a very serious sin against Christ .
@PetriOP It begins with abortion and certainly doesn't end there , which is why Pope Francis uses the phrase " equally sacred " , which JP2 would affirm , as you say .
Hardly , Rich . Protecting the preborn is , since abortion is the sacrament of the secular . I think it ‚Äô s time you found other employment , because , well , you can only go far saying everything ‚Äô s OK with Pope Bergoglio and his friends .
@annacantillo240 @EvanAKilgore @DarrenG71973819 if they ‚Äô re raped they can have conception halted . that ‚Äô s not an abortion . and good for you for being proactive . but if being pregnant puts someone ‚Äô s health at risk , why did they get pregnant ? a child ‚Äô s life shouldn ‚Äô t be taken lightly . no life is more important than another .

@rhyanglezman My Christian brother , was it pro-life to let hundreds of innocent Kurds be slaughtered in Syria ? When we Christians considered the vote in 2016 , we calculated the tragic loss of lives that a Trump presidency would surely entail . Pro Life must mean more than anti-abortion , right ?

@B_Ehrenreich @LivGoodell My mom is 94 and super pro-choice , doesn't get why people need 1000 guns , etc . She is pretty liberal . But she's also a Biden fan . There is no cookie cutter Greatest Gen or Boomer . Oh , and her 25 year old grandson is in favor of dark ages .
I feel like I am in the upside down . Sr . Helen Prejean continues to retweet Kardashian content , and staunchly conservative pro-life Catholics are on Facebook arguing that Kanye is ‚Äú boldly proclaiming the gospel . ‚Äù Who could have imagined 2019 ?
Let ‚Äô s stop calling it ‚Äú the fight over abortion ‚Äù & start calling it what it really is : The fight to grant unborn humans their humanity . The fight to acknowledge that the unborn have value . The fight to have the audacity to not normalize dehumanizing those we deem inconvenient .
@LunaMay196 @CatholicGentlmn @ReproRights All informed consents lay out risks . Accept risks or decline consent . This also applies to intercourse . Same abortion industry mantras ( not my fault , I didn't mean to do it , blame & kill fetus . No acceptance of responsibility

@indiananehemiah @PW_Mpls @FOX59 First what constitutes murder of a stillborn ? Would abortion now be considered murder ? And I mean legally not in someone's opinion . What is she was an alcoholic and drank and her child was stillborn is that murder ? What is she's taking prescription drugs ?

As expected , all Republicans voted to pass the abortion ban . All Democrats voted no on the unconstitutional legislation . H3020 was amended AGAIN with blessing of the leadership to add back the rape and incest exceptions because they were told it wouldn ‚Äô t pass otherwise .

@jacobsoboroff Not nearly so much as the many children killed by abortion in America ...
so these old women hate their kids so much they wish they'd aborted them ? maybe their grandkids will be aborted before they get a chance to pole dance

The misogyny of white supremacy is tied to its racism . They seek to control & subjugate white women to ensure " racially pure " babies . It's easy to see in extreme cases like this , but it also exists in more mainstream culture , like the prolife movement .

Dads don't own their daughter's virginity . The first person who has sex with a girl / woman doesn't own their virginity . Almost like sex is a shared human experience and not a " taking " of something . Having consensual sex for the first time is an experience gained not a loss . K , T . I

More than ever after having a baby tbh . I would never impose this experience on anyone , and I would never wish a tiny baby to be born to someone who was FORCED to have them and might resent them and or even worse abandon and abuse them .
@Rectitude2020 Sounds like pro-choice to me
@Electra661 Are you pro-life ? Do you believe in strong borders ?
Pompeo ‚Äô s Oct . 11 speech to the American Association of Christian Counselors was featured on the State Department ‚Äô s homepage that day . The talk guides his leadership decisions , including to find ‚Äú every dollar ‚Äù of government funding that might support abortion overseas and end it .
@Ardimus @NysPatriotTrump @emuirhead @Thedailymetnews @IlhanMN @CNN And if you and everyone you know haven't had an abortion then abortion is solved ! Problem fixed ! If * your * economy is great , then the trade deficit is solved ! Trade war over ! Do I need to explain how dumb your logic is ? I can use smaller words if that's what you need .

@rozzleberry @AngelaRayner @chelleryn99 He will sell you abortion pills though . Amazing how he can have money invested in something he ‚Äô s fundamentally against due to religion or whatever moral compass he lives on , all the while spouting on about being pro life .

A Catholic priest denied @JoeBiden Holy Communion at Sunday Mass due to his public support for abortion . @PetriOP , co-host of @ewtnradio ‚Äô s " Church Alive " , has analysis of Fr . Morey ‚Äô s decision & explains what canon law says about the requirements for receiving Eucharist .

@Austin_Kaiser47 @OwlFoxVT @FallowsDirk I ‚Äô m anti-abortion and pro-death penalty tho I don ‚Äô t support the way it ‚Äô s currently applied and carried out . But nuanced views on ANY subject are impossible for ‚Äú pro-choice ‚Äù to fathom . They have stereotypes and talking points are unable to deviate from than .
@GoodHeartMommy @frfrankpavone @prolife I think you should homeschool them
One of my most important observations from this whole process is that conservatives , as a whole , put their trust in God , not in govt . People prayed for the judge and his family and our country . The left ? Crickets . Faith in govt . and abortion .
@SturmLLiouville That certainly is essential . But until a few weeks ago women in Northern Ireland has equal access to education but only very restricted access to contraceptives including abortion

Thank you to all the Virginia voters who helped make history last night by flipping the currently controlled anti-abortion General Assembly to a pro-choice majority ! Last night YOU sent a strong message that our repro rights are NOT up for grabs in VA ! Roe Your Vote ! V Ais Blue
@JamesCleverly Remaining is the wise choice it's just the better than anything on the table , but out revoking article 50 is pure madness there needs to be a confirmatory vote on a deal vs no deal and brexit vs remain so we know exactly where the country stands . Revoking is anti democratic .
To make the world we wish for a reality , we must commit to upholding sexual and reproductive health and rights as part of Universal Health Coverage ( UHC ) . Learn more about the @NairobiSummit ( Nov . 12-14 ) and join this global movement : ICPD25 SRHR

My mom is a feminist , never once used the term . Full time working mom / wife , got her masters while working and raising us . Taught us responsibility , demanded respect , and donated to planned parenthood for YEARS . And she cooks , sews and crochets not out of duty but hobby . Superhero
This just goes to show that prolife will believe anything they hear . First they think people eat babies and then this ? A group of people really can ‚Äô t be that gullible , especially when this comes from a prolife biased source with no other sources available . prochoice prolife

@_mooonbaby @KaleidoscopeJen @Nita36419213 @XplosiveTweets @baimcpher Signs dont usually start before 34 weeks , but she saw them at three . Right . Regardless , it was not necessary to abort her child . Also abortion isn't a right , just because it's legal doesn't mean you have a right to it . It's legal to drive , but it is a privilege not a right .

@leonbergers @AliAdair22 Single issue voters believe her & other Televangelists nonsense . As long as they promise Evangelical & prosperity gospel zealots they'll end abortion & make.them richer than poc they'll win . I wish voters would value born children .

@MadamS8N @prochoiceforal1 @Scotty_2017 Well if we were to agree on that abortion would also be out of the question wouldn't it .

@DavidKlion I found out she said some shit like , if you say Republicans are gaining ground we might as well give up on defending abortion and healthcare rights , some bs strawman
Guess what . People who are pro-life care about children in the foster homes . I know sooo many people find different ways to help support these kids . So stop making it seem like pro-lifers are awful humans .

@ChicagoLMC1 @fightforchurch @BishopBarron No Sir ... who could not fight against such atrocities , but abortion ( as with the multitude of recent abominations ) is a symptom of what ails the world ... loss of knowledge of and reverence for Almighty God and unwillingness to follow His Commandments ... man elevating man , not God
and i dont disagree that we've screwed up royally in multiple countries and we're not in any way innocents . the issue is these are religious zealots , of the same ilk as the yahoos domestically who blow up abortion clinics . theyre not going to stop .
3 ) Just because the woman HAS to take on the pain of pregnancy and the ENTIRE responsibility for the child you think they should also be the only one punished ! Most men would pay for the abortion to get rid of the baby !

@StefMNicholas Abortion leads to automatic excommunication . Canon 1398 .

@johnpavlovitz This in itself is a thin veneer , I believe he would be pro choice if it suited him , but this mindset is the reality , and the racial factor is magnified through the issue of abortion .
@hubledinker Absolutely not . But there is no legislative fix for it . That ‚Äô s a parenting problem . Shitty parents were a shitty children that grow up to be shitty adults that use abortion as a form of birth control . Education , , and access to contraceptives will lessen abortion . Laws will not .
This is what pro-choice people endorse

@KrisRHoyt @Matthew71925909 @SheLa9876 @Downeyangel @LeahNTorres @ahaacksucks It must be fun to just blithely assert things without feeling the need to prove them .
