@PattyandSox @fight4women @Leo97894180 @sbmedia78 @DaphGillentine @notlivbrown @KitaSethi @Joshua4Congress Coercing a woman into anything is against the very fundamentals of ‚Äú pro-choice ‚Äù . It ‚Äô s not hidden , it ‚Äô s written on the tin . Choice . Anything that makes it possible to make the right choice to suit the situation is the goal - not supporting coercion .

@mtayanella @dispatch_town " Democrats do " - No , we don't . Late term abortion isn't a big Democrat thing , no matter who tells you so . It's like gun laws , if you try to bring about something such as background checks , the NRA says it's bad b / c they are afraid it's a 1st step . Same with abortion .
@ConservingChris Did you know that the case was built on lies and could be over thrown on that alone ? The plaintiff wasn ‚Äô t pregnant at the time nor did she have an abortion nor did she want an abortion . You can read her book if you don ‚Äô t believe me .
Apparently trying to prevent suicides is the wrong pro-life credential . The GOP doesn't care about anything other than the power they can accumulate .

@maman_de_isla @baimcpher Most women don ‚Äô t have the emotional strength to get an abortion . It ‚Äô s a hard life altering decision women have to make . It has nothing to do with being strong . It ‚Äô s what some have to do regardless of emotions .

Someone who says they support preventing abortions by governments and individual using force in such an amount and of such a nature that no one actually gets an abortion is saying that disagreeing with that is silly . Time to stop talking with them . Life is too short for that .

It is THE most important issue in the world . Either abortion is vigorously condemned with all force we Catholics can muster , and we Catholics strive to end it by all means , even to the point it becomes an unthinkable horror , or we're Catholic only by name , not deeds .
The problem for the Republican Party in Colorado is that they are wrong on the issues & can't gerrymander their way out of it . Coloradans are pro-choice , pro-acting on climate , pro-LGBTQ rights , & anti-Trump . Until the Republican Party changes , they will keep losing . copolitics

@ZubyMusic Abortion is tied to feminism and women should not be ‚Äò burdened ‚Äô by having a baby , just as a man wouldn ‚Äô t be . This is sold as empowering women . In reality they should be standing up for the most vulnerable in society and have to jump though hoops to avoid it .

I honestly do not believe men should have a say . Reason being , from the experience I ‚Äô ve seen with my peers , men don ‚Äô t understand the full extent of the decision they making . They genuinely get to say have an abortion then go on with their lives . Same with keeping the child ...
@EarlofLeuven @simoncoveney There is indeed a consultation process within Strand 3 of the Belfast Agreement . If he ‚Äô s an issue that ‚Äô s the forum to raise it , not in the media .

We'll brush past " acqueise " and I'll refer you to the entirety of my timeline . But I'll give you some specifics to QT and be mad about . Guns . Pro-life rhetoric . Cultural appropriation rhetoric is actually reactionary so I guess I already gave that up .
So they aren ‚Äô t Christians if they support unlimited abortion .
Labour is an anti racist party . Always has been . Jeremy Corbyn is a campaigner for equality and is an anti racist . Always has been . Stop drinking media kool aid ffs Hope this helps .
Well , this is one the Catholic Mafia The Family the Religious Right and all those Vagina Police simply did not win . One would almost think a woman having a legal termination was permitted to have one ; she's a human , or something . Abortion No excuses . No exceptions .

@Jisun_Ho
@detective26AD It's about a woman's right to have dominion over her own body . To make abortion illegal is to take away a woman's autonomy .
@ByronYork The children that were aborted due to her policies and support of planned parenthood
Well said .
@te6192 @DrJenGunter She isn ‚Äô t joyous Over abortion . But there are legitimate reasons to need to not be pregnant . How many times have you been pregnant with a child that has no chance of living ? How many times have you been pregnant and in an abusive relationship where it ‚Äô s devastating ?
How sad is it that we don't value life ...
The panelists also talk about social issues within the African American community . White agrees with other panelists that criminal justice reform is needed . She then brings up abortion and the church's role in alleviating poverty . The convo gets heated .
@liz_franczak Yeah maybe , but seemed pretty weird to frame anti-immigration in labor as a good strategic choice of the vast instead of something that ended with like , hollowed unions and Dolores Huerta as a Clinton delegate .
@DominickDecoko Huh , so abortion will keep the two halves together ? Interesting theory . Did evangelicals really care about POTUS laundering money to pay for the Broidy abortion ?

@TerryMcAuliffe Hard work and a healthy dose of judicial activism . Those judges had no right to change the district map .

@DeborahDiltz @LdyNJ1 @TulsiGabbard She runs democrat for a reason . It ‚Äô s cringeworthy . Even @TuckerCarlson touts @TulsiGabbard as moderate when nothing about her record remotely suggests it . Has he asked her about ties to antifa ? No . @MattWalshBlog swoons because she is iffy on 3rd trimester abortion . crazy
The government has rejected calls to protect women from being harassed outside abortion clinics and an FOI suggests their decision was based on a flawed review . It's frustrating , upsetting and very personal .
These are also , generally , the same people who think that folks who get pregnant from being r * ped should be punished for having an abortion . We really fucking live in the Bad Place , huh .
I was really going to keep quiet about the extremists that sit outside of Planned Parenthood and protest but I was truly traumatized by that shit

@nathanwall03674 @MrogersMy @StevenCoxUSA By definition ‚Äú pro-choice ‚Äù is a political term for an ideology that grants women full autonomy , alleviating the need to qualify it .

@jezmundzmusic @BrandonGroves_3 Doctors who practice medicine in harmful ways in the US can be charged with crimes .

@MomsDemand Nice to see . I don ‚Äô t know the plan , but with Republican controlled states constantly passing more restrictive abortion laws to see what SCOTUS will allow , it ‚Äô s about time we started defining what the 2A actually means .
Abortion is not a human right . Something that has the sole purpose of killing human beings cannot by any definition be a human right . To justify terminating our own species while claiming we stand for humans is barbaric , disgraceful , and a blatant lie .

@peterdaou For facts sake ... Bernie voted AGAINST the Brady bill five times , and EW was a conservative Republican voting against my reproductive rights , and minorities for over 25 years . None of their polices will make it through the Senate , and they know it .
@_AlexPerdue And if you vote for a pro abortion Democrat you were never pro-life and your hatred of Trump has shown your true colors .
@BoofCubensis @tecigurl @getongab So you support the criminalisation of abortion at ANY stage ?
O ‚Äô Keefe has built up from prankster to legit investigative reporter . The Planned Parenthood series should have created a wave of new abortion restrictions but alas O ‚Äô Keefe has no allies in control of academia / media / judicial system
Fuck all you want but your black ass better be on birth control and using a condom because they weren ‚Äô t about to raise nobody else ‚Äô s kids . They were even supportive of abortion as an option IF it got to that point . THAT is proper parenting .

Okay and this is exactly why men shouldn ‚Äô t have a say in a woman getting an abortion THANK YOU
@SadhguruJV Either you are pro-life or pro-choice . There's no middle ground here . The " middle ground " is pro-choice .

I don ‚Äô t like you but I LOVE that you are standing up for abortion rights !
@thatariihoe pro-choice ! I know I'd get an abortion if I found myself pregnant right now for whatever reason . I know there's lots of consequences and pain to it so it's not a decision you make in a split second , it's one you make if you have no choice . which is pro-life people suck imo .
We should note that abortion is Murder . Lesbianism and homosexuality is a grievous Sin Letter To The State
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @ewarren They can lay around and drink Free Dimocrat beer and make babies . Progressive Insurance is a huge contributor to Planned Parenthood and PROMOTING ABORTION .
@WutzDaPassword thats crazy
@bluznshuz Here are more theories on what the songs about . Kurt said that it was about kids with cancer , or it may be about an abortion Courtney had , OR it could be about him wanting to go back inside his mother so he can re do his life .
@KokujinJoe 1 ) I don ‚Äô t believe Trump was sent by God for America , but I ‚Äô ll pray for him anyways 2 ) The Democrats have gone so far off the religion ( ideas like abortion ) that I kinda see where she ‚Äô s coming from .

@USCCB Catholic politicians who publicly call for the murder of babies in abortion should not be given Communion ... period

btw @GeorgiaTech @CabreraAngel when there are demonstrations related to potentially triggering topics ( like the abortion - & suicide-related events this past week ) it ‚Äô s YOUR responsibility to warn students . Just bc we look out for one another doesn ‚Äô t mean y ‚Äô all get a free pass .
But what about birth control ? If a woman doesn ‚Äô t want to risk an unwanted pregnancy , why wouldn ‚Äô t she just use birth control ? If a women can manage to figure out how to get an abortion , surely she can get birth control , right ? Great questions .
Massive week last week for @ReproRightsUN ... & back in the States we ‚Äô re heading to back to the Supreme Court ! SCOTUS has ruled again and again , most recently in our case , Whole Woman's Health v . Hellerstedt , that abortion is a fundamental right .
@PCollinsTimes You said Corbyn's anti-semitism was a disqualification of office . I asked you whether Johnson's islamophobia was the same . I didn't ask you as a " get-out " . I asked you because they are the two candidates to be PM . The choice between them is the choice voters face .

@RosalynBriar I'd be tempted to have one of the characters catch an untreatable STD . A pregnancy may just drive toward abortion , too clean an out . STD makes it more personal .
The 40 year plan to get rid of Roe V Wade is upon us . In this Boom ! Lawyered , @hegemommy and @angryblacklady explain the arguments that would fuel a legal challenge and how that decision could be used to attack state laws protecting abortion rights .

@ClarkeMicah I'm anti Islam so according to Islamists and the left I'm Islamophobic . I don't agree with homosexuality or bisexuality the latter probably a lifestyle choice . I don't agree with the LGBTQ pushing their choices on us heterosexuals as if its normal . But I'm not a homophobe .

Seriously . Is there any more blatant legal gender inequality present in our current legal systems than the disparity between post-conception reproductive rights ? Yet feminists view any attempt to give men a right of parental choice as an attack on gender equality and on women .

Wake up , Jimmy .
@MarthaKarua Just call it by name . Baptizing abortion as " reproductive health / rights " is cowardice . Not here , not anytime soon either .
I pray and hope that Christians in the UK üá¨ üáß too would think about the impact their MP will have on the unborn child - and other biblical values - when they vote - and not simply vote on political lines
@DankProLifeMeme Also , I'm convinced that antichoice people thrive on ambiguity of language and use it to confuse the issue . Conflating negligence / actual murder of a born child isn't even in the same moral category as elective abortion . ( Also , - 2 for improper use of the word ‚Äò conflating ‚Äô )
@Michael49354207 @ahmpacifist @nytimes Yeah , most pro-choice people will tell you that they don't think it should be used as birth control . I am also one of them .

@Swift__Girl I do too . I saw her speak at a Planned Parenthood rally a few years back and her presence was immense . Her questioning of Kavanaugh etc . shows she can put the conservative bullshitters on tilt and make them unravel . Call me a fanboy , I don ‚Äô t care .

@PPFA You're dirty secret is out ! We know you tried to pressure California politicians into forcing churches to provide insurance with abortion coverage and , to have their tax-exempt status pulled if they don't . We ( the pro-life army ) have the emails as proof of your schemes .
If you don ‚Äô t like abortion educate yourself on the standards of living of those in foster care . See that there is no obligation to bring unnecessary suffering that can be avoid before Consciousness even takes awareness . See that hostless cells are NOT consequential . *
@TilterWindmill @jkempcpa I know Evangeical Trumpvoters , tho ' I'm an antiTrump Evangelical : they hung to a pro-life candidate who promised to protect religious rights . I see it as selling out .

@HWoodbery @MSNBC Performing an elective abortion of a viable child for a healthy mother can be no more categorized as " healthcare " , than getting your saggy A cups turned into D cups w / implants .

Abortion is not reproductive health . Reproduction by definition : the production of offspring by a sexual or asexual process . Abortion by definition : the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy , most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy . ( 1/2 )
