@janaenichole4 it ’ s almost like you can taste their contributions to anti-abortion and anti-gun control legislation 🤮
@DDrake1101 @TheRickWilson GOP philosophy at its core is anti-democratic . If the people have power , then the rich are in danger of not being able to make fortunes exploiting workers and consumers . Their only choice is to cheat and lie their way into getting people to give up the power of their vote .

Steve Aiken on BBC refusing to clarify the UUP's position of selecting a candidate for South Belfast shows that they still prefer the DUP over other parties . Take this in perspective : they would rather have a homophobic , anti-Irish , anti-choice , anti-farm party than a Remainer .
@ThomTillis @realDonaldTrump You just don ’ t get it , that ’ s why you ’ re going to be one term . Abortion is between a woman , her family , her doctor , and her God . Not some old white dude in a suit that doesn ’ t have a clue . Patriots over Party . Turn NC Blue !

@NCRonline @MichaelSWinters Unlike the rest of the world , abortion rights are constitutionalized , not legislated . There is no such thing as pro-life voting . The two George W .

@Tip TI . You cant take any feedback from Planned Parenthood who are set up to kill the black family and destroy our children . Ignorant Blacks who jumped on the bandwagon missed your point as elaborate as it was - ur comments were about a black father keeping his daughter SAFE .

@juicyjonjames @DragHris @matmounce @VonshelleB @AlanModracek @TheLaurenChen I did answer " because they want to " that is a plenty valid reason - - just like it is for getting an abortion , a flu shot , liposuction , a rhinoplasty , any of it .. Because they want and its none of your business
The work of these artists is critical . Reproductive rights are under attack , and we can't get complacent or assume that everything will work out fine . We have to put in the work ourselves to protect these rights - - for ourselves and future generations .

As a woman , if you support the statement that women can have abortions without the father's approval , and it's their bodies then you also shouldn't be shocked when a father decides not to take part in the child's life after the mom's refusal to do an abortion . Thats it . LRT
@markbakerprague @emilylhauser Sure , that used to be quite true , but now I'm dealing with people who willfully ignore facts & insist on supporting someone who is a huge national security threat to my country .

@kawashima_ami_ It's gonna take another 10-20 years , but I suspect artificial wombs will eventually lead to changes in abortion law . Abortion would no longer be required when it's possible for the father to raise a fetus to-term in a hospital incubator .
If a fetus is a human being then like all human beings it has no rights to use , violate , or live off of a woman ’ s body . If she ’ s seeking an abortion it ’ s obvious there is no consent for that fetus to be in her body . And bodily autonomy allows for self defense . prolife prochoice

@samaralynn When you promote the  1 Killer of Black Americans via reproductive rights and ignore that 19M + black babies have been slaughtered you are a FRAUD ! This so called black women is working hard to ensure we have no future ! 👇 🏿
@prochoiceforal1 So you're pro-choice for all - - except for the one who's actually being terminated .

@ewarren In a perfect world there would be no reason to have an abortion , we do not live in a perfect world . I know women who've been thete , non took it lightly , infact it was always a very difficult decision for them . Let's not send abortions to the back alley where they came from .
@Teddy_Bhaie @duskyrose3 @Rewire_News No , it isn't . The perfect trade off would be to give vasectomies to every anti-choice man who chooses to have sex with a woman who doesn't want children . You can get it done AND reversed without having to excavate your entire pelvis , AND decrease abortions .
Like .. you do know leftist also want those things right ?
Also contrary to what some were saying today ... abortion is GOOD . It isn't sad and it shouldn't be rare . Touting that narrative is trite and a neoliberal way of guilting women for their choices
A beating heart is an inconvenient truth . The longer the National Democratic party ignores this truth , the more people will leave the party and / or not vote Democrat . chooseboth
@LeahNTorres Yes . A pro-choice woman once told me she would have no reservations about having an abortion right up to the time of birth . I don ’ t see ANYONE on the left pushing for late term abortion restrictions . If no one is doing it , why is it so important to keep it legal ?
. @MikeBloomberg fits right in in today ’ s Democratic Party , along with the other late-term abortion fanatics like @RalphNortham and my opponent @TinaSmithMN ( former Planned Parenthood exec . )
Basically that was a long winded way to finally , fully open up about my abortion . My hope is that it helps contribute to the movement we are seeing of women taking power of their stories . When we speak up , we help lift others out of the darkness & aloneness that is shame .
@mukuba_charity @OdhiamboAloice You argument is so myopic on so many levels . We have men and women that cannot sire children and women who don't want to get abortion doesn't lead to the extinction of the human race ... It's about people's rights to chose .

@prinnylee Like sweety if you think someone who was pregnant at age 15 , had an abortion at age 16 , has a brother accused of raping a child , is married to a convicted sexually offender , grew up with a violent father addicted to drugs is doing ok emotionally then so be it .
@ColeyTangerina Yeah , I'm not a fan of the ' cluster of cells ' argument either . You can feel like it's something to you and still want to have a termination . Given most who access abortion have already given birth , it's not like we don't understand what's happening in utero .

And you know Margaret Sanger , Hillary's hero , started planned parenthood to exterminate the black race right ?
@schultzohio Not a good play or look Greg . Are you also going with the gop tropes that it was the Democrats who were racists & endorsed slavery in the south and that Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist & therefore planned parenthood is evil ? Put your anger toward @realDonaldTrump please .

Ruth Bader Ginsburg is sick again . @realDonaldTrump is feared because of the President ’ s nomination of @Scotus Justices . Eventually one or more additional Justices will be replaced , sooner than later . 2020 will decide : DACA Socialism education Abortion Is Murder taxes

@manny_manatee2 They were anti choice
@WilliamCardin9 @noblesseobleezy @cbusconserv @trumphavnopp @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump I can never understand those who state that they are Christians , but then turn around and support abortion . And these days , the most liberal politicians have even extended the definition of abortion to include infanticide . It breaks my heart .
@RitaPanahi This is why pro-abortion extremists are worse than anti-abortion extremists . Monstrousness vs . an excess of principle .
More Companies Are Openly Supporting Abortion Rights . That May Be Controversial , But It ’ s Also Good Business – Fortune
Dems want full abortion choice . Repubs say " Ur killing . " Repubs want full gun choice . Dems say " Ur killing . " Until there is compromise , neither will change . Prayers .
Yet these fools support full term abortion and taking away the right of others not to participate , they encourage drug use by supplying needles , do nothing for the homeless or folks with mental illness what a disgrace
Rep . Mark Meadows Says Democrats Are ‘ Sucking On Lemons ’ FACT THAT !
@XOashh_ @NobodybutChelz @RideMyBlaine let me make myself clear . I never said women don ’ t have the right to choose what happens with her body . I ’ m VERY pro choice . But the topic was around men having the right to choose as well when they both made the choice to have unprotected sex . All sex don ’ t end up in pregnany .
Too sad for words ! 😢 Comedian Lizz Winstead Thinks Killing Babies is Funny , Takes Pro-Abortion Comedy Tour on the Road 👣
anti-vaxxers who claim “ my body my choice ” are so fucking stupid because having the right to BIRTH CONTROL FOR YOURSELF and ENDANGERING OTHERS BY GETTING THE MEASLES IS NOT THE SAME
@mikandynothem Michael Nothem's background check must have included President Trump , the not-so-stable genius who claims to be pro-life but supports everyone's right to own combat weapons .
Well , Democrats ARE the party of the KKK so ...
@DLoesch Looks like the same people who show up at abortion support groups or an anti gun rally or a Climate Change march . Nothing new here just the usual cast of Soro's characters who have little class but are consumed with their own self hatred .
@NebiajMario @7kidchaos @NARAL By " pro-life " they really mean punishment for sex - particularly if you can get pregnant .

@MiaRogue2 @ZubyMusic I'm talking prevention with these pro-life people . They are talking abstinence and not birth control . Abstinence is not birth control . The ones I talk to don't talk about birth control . I'm being honest here . And , it evolves around education .
@Rosewind2007 @Wikipedia @LullabyTrust @BrandyZadrozny I am not anti Vax , I'm pro Choice . Unlike you , who supports forced drugging
@AMakuyana @lindiedee @AnisiaMichael We aren't talking about gay rights . Why do you feel the need to bring other subjects into discussion ? Abortion does not equal gay rights . Abortion is killing women , gay rights aren't so that's irrelevant .
According to testimony from Dr . Randall Williams , director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Service , the documents sometimes did not include even the doctors who were present for abortion procedures .

i can not help but be awestruck at the amount of men who think abortion is a societal issue and not a women ’ s rights issue
@chrisgeidner @WhodatinSd Most Republicans have already sold their souls to the Devil Trump . Evangelicals too . Power corrupts . There is no democracy in the Republican agenda . They don't believe in anything but selfish profit , white supremacy , racism , anti-abortion-LGBTQ , anti-immigrant & climate change .
Most Millennials want socialism and support killing babies , abortion . The Bible says " Each one of us will give an account of himself to God . " Romans 14:12 . Jesus taught that if he isn't our Lord then we'll burn in hell forever John 14:6 , John 15:14 . Ajax Sondland

@mkt293 @DrSteveJacobs @dylrschn @LeahNTorres My brief skim through it looks like it was reasonably well designed for what it was meant to look at - which was the causes of demographic disparities in timing around abortion access .

" Former Satanist : ‘ I performed satanic rituals inside abortion clinics ’ "
@leftist_dirtbag @iliketosmile8 @AP A physician who opposes abortion for religious or ethical reasons is required to refer to a physician who will and must continue to do so . But there is 0 legal and ethical ground to require a physician to provide any service they are not contracted to do .
Is it really that difficult to understand that Democrats are not promoting abortions ? They ’ re promoting the ability for a women to have a choice on what to do with her body and her life . Hence the term pro-CHOICE .
@charliekirk11 Mike Pence closed down the only Planned Parenthood for a county of 30,000 people , and it led an HIV outbreak over 200 cases . Because it was their ONLY way of getting affordable testing . Mike Pence used Obama Care to get a handle on the outbreak .

After experiencing a training with Created Equal , this is what one student had to say : “ I feel more called to talk about abortion and I feel prepared to . ” - Stephanie , St . Joseph High Invite one of our speakers to your school , church , or pro-life event !

What Triggers Liberals So .. if a man wants the women to have an abortion .. and she doesn't .. does that mean he doesn't have to pay child support ? ! So the man is good enough to pay money .. not to actually get custody and be a dad .. well , that makes sense ! 😂 🤪
@Elizabe18515040 @AllenEdwardRic2 Question ? Who gets paid for the body parts ? The mother who authorized the murder of her baby or planned parenthood who committed the murder ?
@SallyAlbright That happens to be sometimes . Because I defend Planned Parenthood and refuse to EVER support Sanders who attacked us when we endorsed Clinton .

@RGlenwoodTrout @FiatLuxGenesis True , but what's more perplexing are the pro-life academicians infected since day 1 w / TDS . ( i . e . Robert P . George , among others . ) They effectively rooted for what would've been the most pro-death admin ever . Thank God DJT won .
The Republicans in Missouri are scared and it shows . Come after women ’ s reproductive rights and we ’ ll come after your seat . And this race isn ’ t a “ fluke ” . Trust me on this ... it ’ s just the beginning .
@ElieNYC Trying to convince them just makes the dig their heels in further . All they care about is abortion , and they will contort their thinking by whatever means necessary to continue to support the Republican . Facts don ’ t matter . How can you change the mind of that person ?

@FungeonMaster1 @RealJefferyJ @thecjpearson @NickJFuentes The very person who came up with the term , Richard Spencer , is anything but a conservative .

@RealNeilOMahony shame on you . You are pro life ? Being prolife means you are for all lives from conception to natural death , from children to young people , from women to elderly , from migrant to people who have handicap or are too sick , from LGBT people to single parents .
If you are “ pro life ” and agree with this ... just remember life continues after birth and saying a loving couple is unworthy to care for a life that has been abandoned just seems like a contradiction to being “ pro life ” . 🤷 🏼 ‍ ♂ ️
you should be obligated to adopt as many children as you are able to feed if you are aganist abortion

@DrunkAj @BirkMatt This idiot certainly was reveling in it , to no protest .

What does it take to become an abortion provider in the U . S . ? A lot more than you might think .
“ i don ’ t wanna think about a baby being taken apart ” well good thing you won ’ t have to because you don ’ t have a uterus . plus there are things a million times worse that can happen to kids in this world and abortion is not one of them . shut your mouth
where's pro-life now ? or does save the children only apply to fertilized eggs ?
@RobAnderson2018 If course not . They have literally told me fetuses are more important than anyone else , especially immigrant children . They are not pro-life , they are anti-abortion only . Other life is not that important to them .

@GChristiemd @Vermeullarmine 1967 - Episc Church supported abortion where " the physical or mental health of the mother is threatened seriously , or where there is substantial reason to believe that the child would be born badly deformed in mind or body ” & if rape or incest .

Let ’ s be clear . Abortion is not simply a political issue . Disguised under sanitized terms , it ’ s nonetheless the particularly heinous murder of an absolutely innocent child who lacks even “ that minimal form of defense ... of a newborn baby ’ s cries and tears ” ( Evangelium Vitae , 58 ) .

@erinbliss @Mynew11 Not an accident . Evangelicals are a huge voting block , and again , in the 80 ' s , all of a sudden they were taught that nothing , NOTHING was more important than abortion . So , the monied class was able to envelop formerly reasonable people into one issue voters
@chicksonright To Will be interesting . Yes I would think they would just call it a home abortion . Didn ’ t they claim a fetus could even be aborted after birth if the mother wished ?

@gwetabae @kimmy_chierley I'm not judging , & abortion is not the solution . Why not give birth & put the child up for adoption ? Only the WEAK resort to abortion , a person in their right mind takes responsibility head on . I WOULD NEVER ENCOURAGE MY CHILD / SISTER TO ABORT , I WILL LOOK AFTER THAT KID .
@prochoiceforal1 @PCJesus5 @AbbyJohnson Whoa ! That ’ s some serious bitterness on your side ! If she was lying , she would owe all kinds of monetary damage to Planned Parenthood .

@maddow Planned Parenthood is not an abortion clinic . It is for women that are underserved recieve health care . The medical needs of women are substantially more diverse than a mans . Family planning is one aspect but cancer screening , pap test , STD diagnosis and treatment and more
If you struggle with properly framing pro-choice arguments , mentally replace “ abortion ” with “ constitutional right . ” It will help . Here ’ s the key : when articulating your stance , switch back . Abortion isn ’ t a bad word . Stigmatization weakens your position . Don ’ t . You ’ re right .

@realDailyWire I don't know why anyone would be surprise that a lesbian women pretending to be a Christian leader ( Priest ) would be pro abortion ? The very fact that Homosexuality is an abomination to the Christian God invalidates her claim to Priest hood . But that's what the radical feminist do .

When someone pressures you to have an abortion , deceives or lies to you , that ’ s abuse . It ’ s called coerced abortion . Know the signs . And run .
Add it to the list of impeachable offenses from the racist squatter in the WH . His oath is to faithfully execute the laws of the US . He has deliberately sabotaged the ACA ; environmental acts ; abortion , voting and equal rights ; and now he dishonors Native tribes .

Safe abortion is POSSIBLE with the right information and resources . You don ’ t have to do this alone . Please WhatsApp our RRAAM hotline at + 6018 368 7950 for information on safe abortion and unwanted pregnancy .
@BearNamedGreg You can't use their framing . Even talking about " murder " is a concession . The vast majority of Americans want abortion to remain legal as it is , so we need to focus less on arguing and more on winning , and exposing the movement for what it is to deny those rhetorical advantages .
@Carisma015 Ain't that some shit ? This abortion of a president MUST be removed from office .
@ebleas @LeahNTorres Nope . Women get to have sex with no obligation to continue any unwanted pregnancy . If abortion bothers you , you have the right to abstain or get snipped .

Call it what you want . Watch ANY abortion , they won ’ t show that in schools , watch one , and see the baby try get away from the vacuum , or wail as a limb is torn off with forceps . You won ’ t find any “ educational ” facility showing truth . They WILL however teach pedo curriculum .
@StephenPunwasi This is silly , just make abortion , assisted suicide and all contraception available without a referral . I think the prescription system is just an infringement on liberty and an opening for black markets . Are you going to tell religious people they can't be MDs ?

@craig_steger @dawnsaffron @GOP No , because universal background checks and regulations would reduce the number of shootings . Banning abortion would not . In fact , pro-choice policies decrease the overall number of abortions . So if you want less abortion , be pro-choice ( at least to an extent ) .

The left wants to hyper legitimize abortions . Other than Planned Parenthood there is almost no place to get an abortion . Maybe there are some - I can't speak in absolutes . They're anticipating that PP gets shut down . It's a criminal organization , and it's in trouble .
The GOP are literally super villains . If you take a position on saving puppies then they will run on killing puppies and then say " BUT IM PRO-LIFE " in order to divide the population and get votes . If they could outlaw abortion : they wouldn't . They need those votes every cycle .

@LeahNTorres The baby is a person . He or she has the right to live . Allowing a baby that survives an abortion to die is murder .
@ku_gwa Yes that makes sense . However if you are pro-choice you ’ re in favour of the option to choose to abort . I get how there can be a separation however you could argue the two go hand in hand I thought about the right term to use but feel I way about the terms pro-choice and pro-life

@caleb_acker @RickGarnett @NDLaw The truth is very appropriate . She has spent much of her life focusing on abortion , and now , because she agrees with the Trump Administration on that single issue and perhaps some narrow " religious freedom " issues , she is willing to give credence to his " human rights commission .

@nycDSA Unsurprisingly , the DSA openly throws civil rights and women's reproductive rights under the bus at the first opportunity . Authoritarians gotta authoritarian .

@nUrSe_RacHeD @alyslinn @CopperScorpion @joeyjojrshabado @CoryBMorgan Lol . The issue is simple . Abortions shouldn ’ t be uncontrolled . Fathers should get a say before children are aborted and there should be controls around it so women aren ’ t using abortion like birth control or to escape responsibilities unless there is a valid reason .
And speaking of abortion , they ’ re triggered by abortion . And yet they ’ re also triggered by children who get born if they ’ re poor . Also , poor people .

I really don ’ t enjoy how the Democratic Party has made me a one-issue voter by its radical devotion to abortion , I don ’ t think Beshear as governor is all that bad but if he adheres to the mainstream party ’ s precedent on abortion , it ’ s discouraging to say the least
Voting for a " Democrat " is a vote for a " Baby killer thanks to " Planned Parenthood " over 60 million or more killed already . Thank you .
@vsalvatordali @Zorea3 @ScottySweatman @TeaBoots @winning4Him Jesus didn't kill a bunch of protesters . Protesters that have a First Amendment right to protest . You may disagree , but justifying murdering protesters is absolutely NOT what Jesus would do . BTW , you might wanna remove the whole pro-life thing from you feed .

@EMASeattle @thisabadidea1 @AbbyJohnson @Delta To be clear . I admire her work . But it doesn ’ t excuse her unprofessional behavior / temper tantrum That does NOTHING to advance the ProLife movement
@SenateGOP So if i support dems on reproductive rights i am a murder , BUT if i support GOP and there gun initiatives i am not . Abortion kills lives and guns kill lives , NO DIFFERANCE .
@GayManRichard1 Rob Flello is not a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in any election this December , as far as I am aware . I agree his views on things like abortion and LGBT + are abhorrent .
@Reddened64 My point is anti-abortion isn't supported in scripture . Or if it is you haven't helped me find it . Separation of Church and State is our history . We intend to keep it that way .
The bias Twitter has against the pro-life movement is remarkably clear .

@kylegriffin1 Oh , and since I have more cash on hand , I now have even * bigger * standing donations to Planned Parenthood , ACLU , SPLC , NAACP , RAICES , and a host of other Liberal organizations . Thanks for making that possible , MAGA ! Hopefully some of that will trickle down to you . 💙

@pixelprotectors My view : abortion shouldn't be used as a form of birth control period . However I do not agree with forcing a rape / incest victim to carry a child full term . Both abortion and forced pregnancies are negative so let the victim choose the best for them . * I have no label I guess *

Meet Poland abortion dream team . sheroes
Planned Parenthood is just not for women , men go there as well for birth control like vasectomy and to get Viagra . Does the Missouri state health director , Dr Randall Williams keep a spreadsheet on the men who go there - This is a violation of a woman's right and her privacy -
Just chipped in a few bucks to support Planned Parenthood . They're doing good , important work . Every little bit counts .
Fuck ... I need to move wtf

That was disproven by the bill itself . Additionally , the ACLU made abortion legal in all 50 states . Seems to me you don't know what you are talking about .
I wish you could convince @DrJenGunter of this . But she ’ s a “ doctor ” and a “ subject matter expert , ” don ’ t you know ! Just ask her — she ’ ll tell you herself . What she really is is a sick , twisted , abortion-loving hack .

@barbiewonx an abortion
@PetriOP @She_Brings_Joy Once women ’ s reproductive rights aren ’ t respected by a country , it ’ s unsurprising when human rights violations like the Magdalen Laundries , Tuam , and the symphisotomy scandal happen . The misogynist culture begins in the most basic of bodily rights and grows from there .
@charlesadler Okay boomer . Many pro-life MLAs were elected by millions of pro-life Albertans . That's democracy . Pro-lifers are a growing base of voters in Canada , especially in key swing ridings . Youthful , diverse , and organized . We're here to stay and we're going to win more and more .
Well said Ellie they don ’ t want to listen to people who are suffering in agony wanting to end their lives with dignity and compassion with loved ones around them at a place that is of their choosing
Pro Life and Catholic Twitter tonight is the perfect night to curl up with a good , soul enriching book !
@VP No , not when you block certain people to adopt a child . Your homophobic fears are so stupid . Only your very small fake christians are with you . Jesus NEVER said that being gay was a sin . Nor is abortion . In fact the Jews do not believe Abortion is a sin . WWJD w / ppl like you ?
This is ridiculous - how dare Mulcair presume to know what Canadians value . I want a stronger west , jobs for my family , a better future , fewer taxes , a more ethical gov't , and the end to Trudeau . Gay and abortion rights measure nowhere on that scale . Enough from the pundits
@Onomatopoetess @delaine75 @MOApostrophe @kbrownlaw @KatieHill4CA @BradleyWhitford You don't think women die from abortions & abortion-related complications ? Really ? Wow , abortion must be the only risk-free surgery in the world !
I ’ m a believer . I ’ m all in for Trump . When Pence is on vacation in Florida , he attends my non denominational Church . I ’ m deeply concerned by Paula Whites appointment . Her theology is skewed . VERY BAD ! !
a nigga a get you pregnant , you get a abortion & get you right back pregnant like huhhh 😐
