@DickFilet @realginnyrobins @LiveAction BOTH the man and the woman were aware of their consequences prior to laying down with each other .

Say NO to discrimination ! All Lives Matter
@ZubyMusic Because for many thousands of years women have suffered oppression by being unable to control their bodies or fertility . Now they can . Right wingers traditionally oppose abortion , as I understand it , as they prefer a societal model where the family - with Male head - takes primacy
@nwlc Abortion is dehumanizing . It's murder in a particular cases . It's selfishness . And absolutely not a love . It's hate to your own child which makes it even more tragic .

@notsonormalnow Forcing someone to raise a child that they don't want / can't afford is in fact depriving another person of the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

When a low-income woman searches for reproductive care , she often goes to a Planned Parenthood or she might go to a Christian pregnancy center , where she is counseled to carry a pregnancy to term .

The " Deep State " is not the enemy . The abortion activists are not the enemy . The main stream media is not the enemy . They are all pawns being used by the real enemy , and they need our prayers .
@RattlerGator This is the same loop that Planned Parenthood uses . They lobby for money , money goes to them and they support numerous candidates . Do we just refuse to see this or are we okay with it now ? And this isn't the only example , plenty more I'm sure .
@eldepelolargomh @The_NashVillain @ZubyMusic I am pro-life and against the death penalty . But the difference is that if someone is sentenced to death for a heinous crime , society has decided he has forfeited his right to life .

@ewarren No . This is aspect of human frailty that we can't make worse by bringing more accessible abortion clinics to our people . I don't support the gods of money in the Republican party , as I no longer support the Democratic party .
Today , 46 senators voted AGAINST protecting preborn children from abortion after 20 weeks . They voted IN FAVOR of dismembering and poisoning to death children beyond five months , who are often viable and can feel pain . This is extreme and beyond heartless .
Only by the grace of God will prolife Republicans keep control of the General Assembly . I ‚Äô m praying with others that we prevail and anti-biblical Democrats come up short . Will you join me in praying ?

@Pro_life_ANCAP @YoginiCamper @Sam_DeLoach @_celia_bedelia_ that is where the victory really is . Once we recognize the humanity of the unborn , abortions will end regardless of the law .
@Sange1962 @LilaGraceRose A weird and unusual concept would be to keep your nose out of other women's vaginas unless you're giving them a consensual orgasm , you judgmental harpy . Someone having an abortion has absolutely no impact on your own choice not to have an abortion .

@KayFellowz Come the day women as a whole are rejecting abortion , they will be rejecting the feminist conception of " the patriarchy " too . Women have been taught to hate both men and children . They will only be happy when they learn to love both again .

I used to wonder Trudeau , now I've lost any ability to figure but why Canadians are so inclined to elect people who are really stupid and have drug problem . Is it because a dopehead pedo is too busy being a pervert to do anything about the most abhorrent abortion policy on Earth ?
@Amethysista @Dktr_Sus @elpacifico66 @theminorchords The Dems are the ones who are pro-life . The other people are anti-choice or forced birthers . Baby Cagers also works .

@bleakerthan Tim Kaine describes himself as pro-life but has never publicly advocated an anti choice agenda . Like PA ‚Äô s Casey , his votes have been decidedly pro choice . Neither have ever participated in antichoice activism . Active campaigning should count as activism , but ü§∑ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è ?

@tom_hynes @LeahNTorres @HillaryClinton @SER1897 For instance ... The Colorado free IUD program reduced abortion by over 40 % .

Planned Parenthood & other influencers claim they provide mammograms , but nothing could be further from the truth Despite profiting $ 245,000 , 000 last year , they provide ZERO mammograms and own ZERO mammogram machines They don't care about women Watch @PPFA debunk themselves
@KyleaCaesar So this law only applies to facilities that receive federal funding . It's also not limited to abortion it seems , but also access to birth control , referrals , and if doctors are required to give medically accurate information to patients .

Abortion is always intrinsically evil , whereas the State has the right & duty to be able to use capital punishment , subject to certain limited conditions .
@IzziDABELL Bc being pro choice is giving woman the option to do what they want with their own body . Pro choice does not equal pro abortion . It means allowing a woman to make her own life decisions . How can you be pro woman and force them to do something they don ‚Äô t want to do w their body ?

Thanks for joining today's inspiring ICPD25 session on Ending Unsafe Abortion by 2030 . Lack of access to safe abortion results in 45 % of all abortions globally being unsafe , causing a catastrophic public health problem accounting for 13 % of maternalmortality worldwide .
Republicans cheat at everything . Always on the side of darkness in which the end justifies the means . The Democrats have this attachment to honor and transparency . We don't always succeed but that is our benchmark .
@1953_One @JudicialWatch @TomFitton You seem to , again , be talking about to different things .

@roddreher Rod , three of the finest pro-life talks I've ever heard were by Muslims : Shaykh Hamza Yusuf , Suzy Ismail and Imam Sohaib Sultan . All were given at Respect Life Sunday services ( in different years ) in the Princeton chapel . These voices should be heard at the annual March for Life .

The Democrats haven ‚Äô t unified on their strategy to get around the abortion issue in ERA . Nadler celebrated the fact ERA will mandate taxpayer funding of abortion . RepRichmond tried to downplay by calling it a red herring and complaining prolifers are only prolife up to birth .
@EWittekind @IT_not_real @mattyglesias Susan Collins keeps getting re-elected in Maine as if she ‚Äô s a moderate but fell right in party line behind Kavanaugh . A Democratic senator like PA ‚Äô s Bob Casey ( nominally Pro-life ) would almost certainly do the same if the tables were turned .

@thehill This EX is crazy as Trump has encouraged Christians - even if he is a little rough around the edges at times , he is against abortion , favored by many church leaders ( not you ) , & pushes conservative policies making our nation stronger for believers ! Remember this guy is an EX !

@Frobeus_NS This ruling is BS Frobe . There are plenty of places to get abortions . Drs that don't want to do abortions shouldn't have to . End of story for me . An abortion is except under extreme circumstances a completely voluntary procedure . That makes this different .

Earlier , a 16 - year-old girl reported that she had been gang-raped by four masked policemen in the Tsuen Wan Police Station in HK . Her parents had found a lawyer to report to the police and did an abortion operation in the hospital and kept the baby's DNA in the future as evidence .

He is a left-wing extremist on abortion , climate nonsense , & state supremacy over individual rights . He'll draw near-zero GOP votes .

@NameIsJosephine This is why I hate both sides , I am a supporter of the Second Amendment and I'm pro-life , but I can't help but notice the hypocrisy on both sides in regards to how they go about talking about their side . I'm an independent conservative and always will be . Both sides suck !

@UnRestrictMN Abortion care ? ! ? ! Murdering an unborn child is not care . It is can also be very risky for the mother .
God knows who voted for and against lives of innocent babies . You can ‚Äô t be a Christian and vote for abortion . It saddens me that we vote for $ in our pockets over life ! !
@RealMattCouch It ‚Äô s about time that a Catholic Church denied Communion to politicians who support abortion . You ‚Äô re NOT a Catholic when you promote & support abortion ! Politicians can ‚Äô t pick & choose which Catholic teachings they ‚Äô d like to apply to their lives . Can ‚Äô t be 1/2 a Catholic .
The political term for people who claim to be disgusted by republicans but are forced to vote for them because of their anti-abortion beliefs is ‚Äú liars . ‚Äù Those are not winnable voters . If you cave on abortion they will find something else .
For what it's worth to people I don't like abortion , not one bit ... I do not consider it MURDER , as there is less sentience there than the cows we slaughter for food . Also one passage of the bible , God calls life upon " the first breath " which doesn't happen b4 birth V 1/2 V

@cwarshaw @RoperCenter I personally dislike this format of question . It's not uncommon for surveys to ask if abortion laws should be more or less strict . But I have run questions on two polls asking people what laws are in their state . They don't know . So how can they say they want it easier or harder ?
@SRV3RD And even so in time all rights will be given out whether you against abortion or not scientific facts will break though morality and eventually lead the world to a better place .

@tallsportsguy7 @Kevmacd @robbystarbuck Okay abortions ARE healthcare and no one is okay with them up until birth ? The only time an abortion would happen that late in pregnancy is if the fetus is dead or would kill the mother .
@Bearcat50 So you are saying that an executive could get away with all kinds of lawlessness as long as the right judges continue to be appointed ? And the same thing could potentially on the left . A lawless democrat could rule without defiance - if he kept prochoice judges on the court .
