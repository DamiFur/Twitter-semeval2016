Thank God for the AR Guns . We women like them . They are easy to use . We need them for self protection . Stop Demagoguing guns dumb Elite suburban Moms . Yet you protect abortion-murdering babies .
@Bowiegrrl1 @DKinMN @RidgewayGirl01 Warren & Sanders voters fail to recognize the dangers of State run health care in the hands of Republicans . We can ’ t assume Democrats will always be in power .
💥 💥 For decades the Gov ’ t failed at managing healthcare for our heroes who use the V . A . Healthcare System . What makes liberals think they can do so for the entire country ? Ignore the incredible Waste , Fraud , & Abuse of our current system and then expand it ?

You show them the slippery slope of abortion , and they don ’ t believe that Jeffrey Sachs is not just “ some guy ” but a highly influential ethicist who advises the UN on sustainable development and Pope Francis . If only these otherwise well-meaning people would wake up !
Never be afraid to share your prolife beliefs with those around you !
Sen . @dennisbaxley is using white supremacist rhetoric to support SB404 and his anti-abortion agenda 😤 . Does @Gayle_Harrell who chairs the committee about to vote on the bill share this view ? Ask her = >
@onlyadoorkeeper @MoggMentum The DUP don't believe women should have the right to choose an abortion and that gay couples should not be afforded the same rights as heterosexual couples . Not agreeing with the DUP sounds like a good thing
@haysquirt @BUpshaw @sass_political @KatelynTweeter Yes - you may be interested in a project I ’ m currently working on : a dialectic between a prochoice and ProLife person - We ’ re exploring both sides of the subject via letters to one another .
@charlesadler Yeah and since then the @CPC_HQ has a . 500 record at winning elections , more than the record of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada . Also , the only time the @CPC_HQ won a majority and saw an increase in votes and % in the 905 was in 2011 , when they had a pro-life policy .

What sad news . I used to watch the repeat of the Late Late Show in the early years of Channel 4 . It was a remarkable show - razor-sharp debates on LGBT and abortion issues alongside fireside chats and a homespun manner . RIP , Gay .
@blackr0se_x @bubblylimelight I'm not one of them , but there are liberal Mormons out there that are pro-life . Quite a few in Utah , and growing . They're liberal but can't quite get past the abortion thing . I'm just a liberal Mormon that's pro-choice , let you ladies chose what's best for you .
@branwen1978 @DrJenGunter Pray tell , what is the magical age when a fetus turns into a baby ? Fetus used to be a medical term used by medical people , now it's mainly used by laymen to refer to an unwanted baby ( abortion = unwanted baby ) . Dehumanize first !
@abby6179 @theblaze I don ’ t agree with abortion . But I would assume because taking meth is not a legal way to abort a child .

@JulieACorr @ussf79 So who will the anti abortion SDLP Electorate transfer to in North Belfast ? Will they follow the lead of the Catholic Church and vote the only anti abortionist candidate on the Ballot paper Nigel Dodds ?

@RougeMenace @luneargentee @prochoiceforal1 @AbbyJohnson The end of legalized abortion is coming ! Why else would you dehumanize the unborn and completely ignore basic biology ?
@prairiemonk1 @spinangora @NCRonline It seems so much to fit , celt . There's a deep Ur-lie , as it were , under so much of it . The so-called " pro-life " movement was born in opposition to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s . Racism is baked into that movement . But there's such lying about those racist roots .
Thanks to the election of both Trump & Pence conservative anti-abortion groups have a direct pipeline to the presidency . And they've made the most of it , using that proximity to enact policy changes that radically diminish reproductive health care options

Okay listen up prochoice Here's ur argument . " Abortion isn't murder coz a fetus isn't a person " When does he become a person ? " After he's born " So following your logic , just seconds before birth , a baby isn't a person yet therefore in theory can be killed by him mom at will

@Destroyer7795 @washingtonpost That's reducto ad absurdum . No doctor I've ever know has had to perform an abortion against his will . Doctors refuse to do a wide variety of procedures they know how to do because either they think it's not good for the patient or they simply do not agree with the treatment .

@badbitchbbeca At least you knew sooner , and there are ways to prevent having a child but it's kinda sad but if you're not ready or with the wrong person , you can get an abortion but if you want it , get it soon cause it's still not fully developed .
Opinion | The new legislation places undue restrictions on would-be surrogates ’ bodily autonomy and reproductive rights . The government has offered no logical rationale for why unwed and childless women should not be surrogates .
Challenges include lack of financial investment in guaranteeing universal access to information and services . Slow shift in negative gender and social norms that are barriers to accessing information and services especially for adolescent girls and young women . Reclaiming ICPD
@AndrewSolender " Culture war " ( attacking reproductive rights + LGBT rights ) is like 80 % of how these right-wing sites get clicks .
Per usual , opposition to the notion that the mother has absolute dominion over the life of the child is conflated with a denial of her rights and dehumanization . This is not a rational position .
@AmberBobamber @sisu1964 @InjuredAlex That ’ s asinine . Being religious isn ’ t the only basis for recognizing the moral failings of abortion-as-birth-control .

@mini_mama49 But the GOP opposes environmental protections , food and labor safety regulations , access to health care , access to SNAP , they're pro war and pro death penalty . GOP policies kill and kill gleefully . Voting for them is not pro life .
Abortion is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please or appease a deity , supernatural beings , sacred social order . It is a form of human sacrifice . Throughout history it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion .

@JudicialWatch Do you know the market price for a fetus ? Correlation of market price & days old of fetus / baby ? As age ( days ) increases so does the value ? D's block ' born alive ' bill ? Planned Parenthood political donations ? Do you believe this has anything to do w / a Woman's Right to Choose ? Q
Not suprising . Republican Governor @GovParsonMO has been leading the charge to push access to legal abortion completely out of reach in Missouri , including passing one of the most cruel and dangerous bans on abortion in the nation . Track This Randy moleg

@CombatDebater Hi Combat Debater ! 😊 You tweeted 👉 Planned Parenthood is a stranger than strange federally funded group , IMO . " Its combined annual revenue is US $ 1.3 billion , including approximately $ 530 million in government funding such as Medicaid reimbursements . " 🤔
@NIOgov @dontscreenusout 2/2 ... can be that every couple with is recieving a disabled child is ' forced ' to decide for an abortion . And it seems to be that this is happening already in England / Wales . And then are children rights not there anymore . A whole innocent group of people is selected .
@DavidNmundia See ! I knew if we conversed long enough we ’ find something in common . I agree we need to teach pro choice people the truth . If someone has an abortion we should love them and help them . If someone gets divorced we should love them too . But we should NOT help further that agenda .
Eye surgeon turned GOP Senator Rand Paul voted to defund Planned Parenthood , blocked the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund , and believes climate science is ‘ not conclusive . ’ How exactly did this InfoWars favorite become a powerful Trump lap dog ?

@chrisadonnelly Hi Chris , I'm afraid that is an echo chamber . A Citizens ' Assembly doesn't start with the idea that a proposition is a good thing . The CA on abortion didn't work on that basis . It gave the both sides of the argument and left the decision to the public . If the only people 1/2

@deliciousnarry @baimcpher @savvie_j They objectively are . If you get an abortion because you just don ’ t want a baby , you shouldn ’ t have gotten pregnant in the first place . You ’ re not pro choice , you ’ re pro abortion . You want there to be a bustling abortion industry for some reason instead of trying to reduce them .

This is one of the hardest thoughts that I struggled w after my abortion ; knowing other people are having a hard time trying to conceive and here I am . This brought me a lot of solace , thank you .

@AinsworthKeith @Dainty128006177 The reason they teach evolution in schools is so that you don't value life . Then there's no argument against abortion . Once you accept that , post-term euthanasia is a valid choice for babies with health issues . Then the elderly . Then the sick . Then " deniers . " This is eugenics .

@ImJackFrank @tonygoldmark Ah yes , I was right , the Test for an Unfaithful Wife , Numbers 5:11- 31 . They literally give a woman an abortion in this scripture on God's authority .

@PiusOP @patrickmadrid @CatholicHerald Jesus did not deny Judas communion . God's free gift of the Eucharist brings us together . Jesus was not lawyer , but a pastor . Yes abortion is wrong , but there are many interconnected factors : poverty , education , etc .. Jesus stood with the sinner ...

@dhighway61 @Aella_Girl @gailfinke @wglane3 If you can convince me a fetus is conscious and pain aware then you can make me oppose abortion , you can't trick me into opposing it just by trying to trick me into thinking a fetus and a baby are the same thing .

@Evhw1 @ribotoxins It's probably about the government wanting to make Poland a fully catholic country .

@AlainnFocail @tsmendola I think the end argument is that it needs to be safe and legal . Nobody gets to judge how they ’ re going to feel after an abortion until they ’ ve been there . Science and religion should not cohabitate in our government .

@lana_marie78 @brycetache I ’ m curious as to why you you are pro-choice when you have so many attributes
So I heard a story of a female that told this guy she was pregnant and she needed $ 800 for the abortion but she was never pregnant ... that ’ s probably the easiest $ 800 a female can make on god 😂 😂 😂

@Docstockk Around 2012 I got to a rock-and-a-hard-place point where I realised all the linguistic compromises I'd committed to in my journalism in order to quietly avoid charges of transphobia were directing the kinds of thoughts it seemed allowable to express , particularly around abortion .

So what exactly is “ leftist propaganda ” ? Affordable health care ? No student loans ? Gender equality ? LBGTQ + equality ? Reproductive rights ? Wow , must be rough being a liberal 🙄
Ben . We like dogs , too .
Coincidentally , if you try and restrict access to abortion , there will be a lot more women with cold , dead hands after dying from back-alley abortions . This is a matter of life and death for people who can get pregnant .

@FrancesGruno @lambert_pp I think Scheer was a mistake ; however no one should be forced to march in parade it should not be an issue . Nor should his faith and abortion . I didn't see any questioning Singh about gender selected abortion in the Sikh community where females are aborted . How about fgm Hussen
I worked hard on this , RT & like Pro Life End Late Term Abortion End Satanic Ritual Sacrifice Trump2Q2Q Jesus Saves God Is Great MAGA The Childrens Crusade
@dondelotell12 @EvanMcMullin @BaddCompani Respectfully replying that I noticed the US Catholic Bishops urged their flock to vote for him---based on his lie that he was " prolife " when it was clear he was a liar & a thief . Yes , these charlatans are awful & any religion that tells me how to vote is the one I walk away from .
So you're pro-choice ? Tell me do you chose to be burnt at the stake or have your head chopped off ?
@GrannyMooninVA Good news . Got a notice about the election of our Democrat leader who supports planned parent hood . Which saves women's lives . Which we helped save planned Parenthood 2016 and 2018 . So yeah . Good news . Enjoy the upcoming weekend .

@SenBlumenthal @SenToomey Does your Bill include Abortion Dr ’ s . ? Save The Baby Humans
@annacantillo240 Hi woman with a uterus here . @EvanAKilgore is right . Abortion is murder . You don ’ t have the right to a kill a baby all because you want to continue being a whore . Don ’ t want a baby ? Close your legs . Plain and simple .
@iamemilymoses @songsides @Happywife151 @Godisgood1836 @LaFuller21 @baimcpher I feel so sorry for you that basic biology has failed you . Human DNA is present at fertilization . Be pro-choice ALL you want , but don ’ t be ignorant to deny the science there . DNA doesn ’ t lie .
it was a mistake following these catholic girls on instagram they ’ re out here posting mother teresa quotes and shit trying to justify being pro-life 😐 i promise you that clump of cells is not gonna be upset

@MotherJones Nope . Abortion bans are reproductive slavery and torture .

@Hegemommy I initially passed . It's Caitlin Flanagan , so you can expect the wistful pining for life in 1962 , but it makes a surprising argument : that we're not really arguing about abortion , because women always had them and always will . We're arguing over whether to make it safe and legal .

@JimInhofe @SenatorLankford I may have found an unwanted baby for either of you to adopt father doesn ’ t seem to care for it so I assume since you two can afford it and are big Pro-Life fans here is your chance !
If birth control doesn ’ t , abortion does
It makes me sad to see prolife women so blindly throwing away their own rights and ownership to their bodies . I urge them to find help and to try and understand why they resent themselves so much they have to not inflict suffering onto other women but themselves . prochoice

She should be ashamed . Too irresponsible to keep her legs together ? use birth control ? Adoption rather than the outright murder of an innocent child .
@ddwiese @JulieReichwein1 Any conservative in Kentucky who voted for a pro-choice candidate over a pro-life one because he was “ messing with teacher ’ s pensions ” is not a conservative . Judas comes to my mind .

@yoozylace Eew Dominos . Not only do I not like their pizza but the owner is a Bible banger who is against women's reproductive rights .

@southerngal56 The idea of a survivor speaking out is well , illogical reasoning . Of course they ’ re glad they ’ re here , but they wouldn ’ t know any better if they weren ’ t . But no , far from dim and never heard an abortion survivor speak ... most likely due to aforementioned rationale .

@charliekirk11 I do not understand why Planned Parenthood even receives funding . They do not give free abortions.They have no advertisement cost . Their buildings are paid for.The employees love killing babies , so they should be volunteers . They give D ’ s $ and they get $ It ’ s just quid pro quo .
Yep ! If a fetus is not a human life then neither are you and I .

@GrahamLedger It's " MURDER " not abortion .
@GhostOfRedBeard My father was just the opposite but he taught me about the value of human life . That ’ s why I ’ m behind you 100 % on your pro-life stance .
Women don't deserve privacy it seems .
@Sam_DeLoach @eyes_greene @spacemanspiff76 @DaphGillentine @carissarenard @coffeemama91 @FeministEmiIy You've kind of proved my point there . As well as risk of illegal ( and unsafe ) abortion , banning abortion causes a drop in maternal health . Why advocate for that if you truly value life ?
really disappointed they didn't refer to her show as an early abortion
@Buzzsaws1990 @Leo97894180 Fascinating that you talk that way to victims and NOT to the cops who dismiss victims the same way you do . You're always looking for a way to pin the rape on the victim , not the rapist or those who protect them = = like you . Prolife rape apologia is a helluva drug .
@TeaPainUSA I know people who are against abortion and even those folks don't like to hear Trump and Republicans lying about abortions . They say it hurts their cause , not helps . Power corrupts the mind .

I live in the Bible Belt , and 100 % of the arguments against abortion made to me …
That's a great endorsement ,
@NewYorkStateAG More than getting happy because abortion is legal which it is a choice man and woman should be more educated about protecting themselves and exploring all options available for man and woman to avoid having to choose abortion instead of .
@jonicaaa you should look into doing it at planned parenthood fr . i ’ m sure it still costs a decent amount , but it should be cheaper .

Stealth laws that shut down abortion clinics may not technically be abortion bans . But they have the same effect : creating a landscape where patients might have the right to an abortion on paper , but cannot access it .

@KyleJamesHoward I do think about them , but the narrative is that with the end of George Wallace ’ s 1968 candididacy , both parties have been pro civil rights .

This is why elections matter . Go vote . Then watch and tweet your elected officials that you will not tolerate these bills anymore !
@Downeyangel @Groucholiz @laurenarankin Maybe , I'm not expert . That's based on the articles I've ready regarding fetal development ( neutral , not pro-life or otherwise ) .

@ericthehamster @Rachael_Swindon Agreed . I'm a Christian , and whilst abortion isn't something I'd consider myself , I also can't imagine how distressing it would be for a woman ( and ultimately the child ) to carry and give birth to a child , a constant reminder of such a traumatic event as rape . Judge not etc .

@snehalmanjrekar @PsychoSchmitt Absolutely . In India , urban parents are more able to realise their pre-existing preferences for a son , so sex selective abortion is often higher in cities . This was the same in the early years of industrialisation in South Korea . Many exceptions . See also 1950s London .

I'll say it again , Conservative Evangelicals are the dumbest group of people on planet earth . All you have to do is lie and say you're Pro-Life and Pro-Israel , and they'll have a spiritual orgasm right in front of you and follow you to Hell , just like they're following Trump .

Next year , Louisiana will likely become the first state where women have no access to their constitutional right of abortion . At all . They will have to go to another state . This is what it looks like when the GOP has unmitigated power : a total loss of bodily autonomy for women .
I have a confession . I cluelessly voted Democrat in 2018 along pro-choice lines . It was a mistake that I regret . I was only considering one side ; the idea of a woman being free . The baby most certainly is alive and has an inherent right to live . I ’ m sorry .
guys these people are literally a disease but i cant stop looking at this shit and laughing help they ’ re so passionate abt wanting women to be oppressed . “ abortion WILL end in my life time . ” LMFAOOO THE DRAMA OF IT ALL I CANNOT ! ! !

@MahgdalenRose The first thing is they would destroy the health care system to the point where nobody would be able to get on time health care , then they would start paying for , encouraging , then enforcing abortion AND euthanasia . Anyone remember Logan's Run ?

@Jesus_porvida does Planned Parenthood tell women there are people like you out there ? Or do they not even broach this option ?
@Sassenach_85 I appreciate your response . There are also pro-choice clergy & religious organizations that offer help / counseling . It is because of pro-choice clergy that legal abortion exists . There are full service clinics that provide ALL options and assistance no matter what people choose .

@DrJenGunter Well worth noting termination of pregnancy isn't in the scenario . She is talking about how 𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 pregnant should be a mandated obligation . She inadvertently betrays that the conservative position on abortion has never been about ' sanctity of life ' Prochoice Antichoice
" People may not be aware of the potential for local municipalities to advance reproductive freedom , " says @AMillerNIRH on @nirhealth ' s nationwide look at " the tremendous creative work that we are seeing at the municipal level . "
He is actually , cause he was threatening that he won't be a father to the child she was carrying . He was using psychological blackmail on her . If you don't wanna be a father , don't have sex or use protection . It's that simple .
Apparently adoptees should not be prochoice and of course , above all else , adoptees should be grateful . Adoption Is Trauma NAAM
@thegoodgodabove They're so pro-life , you'd think they'd feel guilty about their unvaccinated brats infecting , & seriously harming or killing , infants too young to be vaccinated . But then , their self-righteousness apparently excuses them from behaving like responsible members of society .
This isn't an anti veteran tweet . Support there is a personal choice , but don't tell me Irish lives are worth so little . Support your troops if you want , but hold them to a higher standard .
I don ’ t know who needs a reminder , buttt the term “ pro-life ” is a made-up term aimed at demonizing and dehumanizing women who exercise their right to control their bodies and their allies .
@SharleenBwakura @TeeKayZim @ZiFMStereo A person becomes a person once they are born . That is why abortion is performed within a few weeks after conception before embryo develops into a baby . The right to do what you want with your body is also a human right . If abortion is killing what is using morning after pills ?
@JoyMosenfelder @Sam_DeLoach @DrSteveJacobs Someone dies in every abortion . The fact that you completely ignore that detail is very telling .

@brianlilley @BrianMasseMP @NDP Brian , Scheer didn't lose because of his beliefs ... he lost because people saw him as chameleon . He was trying to pacify the pro gay & pro abortion population by saying he would not bring up legislation . Christians were saying with him in power legislation will be changed .
Joanna Newsom's " Baby Birch " may be the most bone-chilling song about abortion ever written . I pity women who make abortions and end up fucking their own heads torturing themselves in guilt . That makes me despise even more those feminists who try to normalize such brutality .

True . I don't know how I can get along with hateful leftist maniacs who lie and disparage at every turn .
@lifeinthegaps Being prolife should be a non partisan issue . Planned Parenthood made it political by controlling its politicians with $ $ and report cards . As a Democrat ( lately a DINO ) I ‘ ll never understand why the Democratic platform doesn ’ t support the least privileged , most vulnerable of us .

The abortion hearing , titled “ Examining State Efforts to Undermine Access to Reproductive Health Care ” will feature testimony from abortion advocates and Planned Parenthood staff .
I'm so thankful for this bc when I posted about being accidentally pregnant I got a message saying I'm triggering women who want to get pregnant into a terrible place n all it made me do was feel guilty n shit for wanting an abortion .
@Truth_Thumper @markvaud @LiveAction You're forgetting the Bible reminds Christian's that we're to hold each other accountable to God's Word . In this case , " though shalt not kill .

@Mpachol @Zeratoth @VitoGesualdi You said you didn't want any tax dollars going towards it .

That way , you can sanctimoniously oppose abortion , without ever having to inconvenience yourself thinking about the grey zone .

@GovMattBevin @ACLU Pro Choice doesn ’ t mean Pro abortion ! But Pro Life makes you a Forced Birther . What happened to freedom of choice ! ? ! If life was really important to you then why not protect God Earth !
So let's recap : It's not Pro-Life , It's Pro-Misogyny . A zygote is not a baby A blastocyst is not a baby An embryo is not a baby A fetus is not a baby , it just starts to look like one . It's not technically a baby until the 8th month . 1 / notababy
What if real life had achievements like Xbox ? ? ? Bitches be leaving the abortion clinic ... PENTAKILL
So much for being “ Prolife ” . Antichoice only care about the fetus & controlling women . prochoice Abortion Is A Womans Right abortionishealthcare
For more info :
people preach about adoption instead of abortion then make bullshit laws like this .. smfh
Absolutely disgusting . I lost my child to abortion . I never knew that the women I was with at the time was pregnant . She never told me . It broke me inside when I found out I could have been a father , I ’ ll never know my child here on earth but I will meet that child in heaven .

@Shelbywa839 Incase you ever need this information : The year before RvW , 39 women died from illegal abortions in the US . Not millions . Not thousands . Not hundreds . 39 Now women are better off & have more support / resources so that  would go down Legalized abortion kills 900k + humans / year
@chamiltongalaxy @daviddaleiden @JVanMaren @NatAbortionFed @PPFA It's obviously clear u have * not * watched the videos or u would not be so uninformed about what the PP " doctors " flat out stated about pricing , covering up pricing * illegally * changing abortion procedures to get the best " specimens " These are all crimes . Planned Prisonhood for PP
@Lothdashaus @HataHZappa @cjzero Now that ’ s a huge group of people going to hell forever . Miscarriage happens far more often than abortion . Why would any rational person be convinced that a god who sends innocent unborn babies to hell is good and loving ? Sounds like a sadistic tyrant to me .
@KRBaldridge @donna_spackman @jmrbux2 @VoteMarsha @realDonaldTrump 🤬 🤬 🤬 Blackburn is gross . She also gave a huge assist to big opioid pharma killing Tennesseans whilst she watches our rural hospitals close ( she's trying to get rid of the rest of them ) then has the gall to pretend she's " pro-life " . Whoever she plays 4 it sure AF isn't Jesus

Seriously , it ’ s not enough that it ’ s legal but know we have to perform them too ? What has happened to our country
Completely brilliant story by a young NZer about her abortion in South America . 1.This girl can write . 2 . Yes , black humour . 3 . WTF South America
@SkyNews So we get the choice of a liar who supported May's deal and then brought back most of her deal with some slight improvements . Corbyn the terrorist sympathizer and anti-semite . If that wasn't bad enough , we get a enemy of democracy . No thanks .
@schmangee You ’ re incorrect . Having spent some time in a very very Red State , I can tell you that abortion and gun rights motivate the Right more than any individual policies move the Left . Immigration is creeping into that duo , as well .
@mfjlewis @USCCB Its members will not even call me pro-life because of my stances that oppose GOP politics .

I don ’ t understand why so many people who oppose abortion are in favor of the death penalty ? 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ Life is life , why those people think they can judge and choose who ’ s allowed to live and who doesn ’ t ?
@KenFX4 @thinkngpolitics @dlongenecker1 If being prolife was a strictly religious view , there wouldn't be atheist prolife groups ! science
If you are , literally , pro life , @PoliticalKathy , does that also make you , literally , against pro choice ? Asking for a friend because you still haven't responded to him ..
@QTAnon1 @CrisMathew1 There was talk about global population growth back then , doomsday talk just like climate change now . But that doesn't make you God to decide if abortion is right or not .

I ’ m pro choice i am for abortion for rape victims , harms mothers , or lack of education but dont have unprotected sex to be a wild card if you dont want baby just to abort it . Whatever . Don ’ t have sex , period .
@PassTheSalty Human : Donald Trump has been accused of Sexually assaulting 14 woman , Been charged with fraud , cheating on 3 wife's and paying off a porn star . Why do you vote for him ? Evangelical Christian : Because he won't let the Gays get Married and will ban abortion . Things important to me .

@MyNameIsEarlB @LilaGraceRose There is only talk about Planned Parenthood performing abortions . There are many , privately owned abortion clinics . I'm betting it's mostly those , that are selling baby body parts to corporations Here is one . Just to show ... clinicshttps :/ / womancare-abortion.com/
@caliconlatina Which brings me to my next topic ! ! ! i think its funny that you mention that you ‘ dont care about pronouns ’ in your bio because what if these children you want to protect so much grow up to be trans , non-binary , gay , an atheist , poverish or a democrat ? ? ? Are you pro life then ? ?
@Alyssa_Milano Dear @Alyssa_Milano , I think you ’ d be better served to take a good hard look at what got you to where you are . How did you become such a hypocrite ? Why are you hell bent on pushing the abortion agenda on America ? And what brought you to this place of complete and utter denial ?
@frequentbuyer1 The only possible conflict I see with a moderate republican or Democrat is the pro-life stance . A subtle compromise here puts you with many centrists . I ’ m a moderate R , but my party has shifted away from its traditional values and morphed into something unrecognizable .
So when Joe Biden or any of the other members of the Dem circus recite their talking point of being for the little guy , keep this in mind . Pro Life
@pigybank @BroccoliR0b Said the “ prolife ” “ pro-gun ” hypocrite . Bombed any healthcare facilities , shot any doctors or bullied any women lately ?
@ReillocNaes @SenFeinstein Pro-choice isn ’ t forcing anyone to live according to someone else ’ s opinion or emotions . If you don ’ t like abortions , don ’ t get one . However , you don ’ t get to make the decision for anyone else .

@SimonthegoatUK Abortion day cakes .
The Ohio Senate just passed SB 155 which would require physicians to inform folks of an unproven procedure that claims to undo the effects of a medication abortion . This is medically INACCURATE ! Shame on anti-abortion legislators for passing this junk science . Stopthe Lies
@peyrose13 Respectfully can you point to a section of the Constitution that says the legality of abortion is up to the federal government ? ( I am not supporting abortion nor am I agreeing with abortion )
Mother here . I ’ ve had an abortion before and you know what if they circumstances aren ’ t right , I ’ ll have another one . Mind ya business .

Paul George is really with the woman he was trying to pay off to have an abortion 😂 he tried & failed then the happy family ending happened
@OnstadWalter @BrittPettibone Your thinking is correct , but you don't take into account the fact that the pro-choice league is importing members . Also , I'm pro choice politically and personally , because abortion isn't coercion and if my wife has a malformed fetus I'll abort it .
