Thank God for the AR Guns . We women like them . They are easy to use . We need them for self protection . Stop Demagoguing guns dumb Elite suburban Moms . Yet you protect abortion-murdering babies .
@Bowiegrrl1 @DKinMN @RidgewayGirl01 Warren & Sanders voters fail to recognize the dangers of State run health care in the hands of Republicans . We can ‚Äô t assume Democrats will always be in power .
üí• üí• For decades the Gov ‚Äô t failed at managing healthcare for our heroes who use the V . A . Healthcare System . What makes liberals think they can do so for the entire country ? Ignore the incredible Waste , Fraud , & Abuse of our current system and then expand it ?

You show them the slippery slope of abortion , and they don ‚Äô t believe that Jeffrey Sachs is not just ‚Äú some guy ‚Äù but a highly influential ethicist who advises the UN on sustainable development and Pope Francis . If only these otherwise well-meaning people would wake up !

@onlyadoorkeeper @MoggMentum The DUP don't believe women should have the right to choose an abortion and that gay couples should not be afforded the same rights as heterosexual couples . Not agreeing with the DUP sounds like a good thing

@charlesadler Yeah and since then the @CPC_HQ has a . 500 record at winning elections , more than the record of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada . Also , the only time the @CPC_HQ won a majority and saw an increase in votes and % in the 905 was in 2011 , when they had a pro-life policy .

@blackr0se_x @bubblylimelight I'm not one of them , but there are liberal Mormons out there that are pro-life . Quite a few in Utah , and growing . They're liberal but can't quite get past the abortion thing . I'm just a liberal Mormon that's pro-choice , let you ladies chose what's best for you .
@branwen1978 @DrJenGunter Pray tell , what is the magical age when a fetus turns into a baby ? Fetus used to be a medical term used by medical people , now it's mainly used by laymen to refer to an unwanted baby ( abortion = unwanted baby ) . Dehumanize first !
@abby6179 @theblaze I don ‚Äô t agree with abortion . But I would assume because taking meth is not a legal way to abort a child .

@RougeMenace @luneargentee @prochoiceforal1 @AbbyJohnson The end of legalized abortion is coming ! Why else would you dehumanize the unborn and completely ignore basic biology ?
@prairiemonk1 @spinangora @NCRonline It seems so much to fit , celt . There's a deep Ur-lie , as it were , under so much of it . The so-called " pro-life " movement was born in opposition to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s . Racism is baked into that movement . But there's such lying about those racist roots .
Thanks to the election of both Trump & Pence conservative anti-abortion groups have a direct pipeline to the presidency . And they've made the most of it , using that proximity to enact policy changes that radically diminish reproductive health care options

Okay listen up prochoice Here's ur argument . " Abortion isn't murder coz a fetus isn't a person " When does he become a person ? " After he's born " So following your logic , just seconds before birth , a baby isn't a person yet therefore in theory can be killed by him mom at will

@Destroyer7795 @washingtonpost That's reducto ad absurdum . No doctor I've ever know has had to perform an abortion against his will . Doctors refuse to do a wide variety of procedures they know how to do because either they think it's not good for the patient or they simply do not agree with the treatment .

@badbitchbbeca At least you knew sooner , and there are ways to prevent having a child but it's kinda sad but if you're not ready or with the wrong person , you can get an abortion but if you want it , get it soon cause it's still not fully developed .
Opinion | The new legislation places undue restrictions on would-be surrogates ‚Äô bodily autonomy and reproductive rights . The government has offered no logical rationale for why unwed and childless women should not be surrogates .
Challenges include lack of financial investment in guaranteeing universal access to information and services . Slow shift in negative gender and social norms that are barriers to accessing information and services especially for adolescent girls and young women . Reclaiming ICPD
@AndrewSolender " Culture war " ( attacking reproductive rights + LGBT rights ) is like 80 % of how these right-wing sites get clicks .
Per usual , opposition to the notion that the mother has absolute dominion over the life of the child is conflated with a denial of her rights and dehumanization . This is not a rational position .

Abortion is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please or appease a deity , supernatural beings , sacred social order . It is a form of human sacrifice . Throughout history it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion .

@chrisadonnelly Hi Chris , I'm afraid that is an echo chamber . A Citizens ' Assembly doesn't start with the idea that a proposition is a good thing . The CA on abortion didn't work on that basis . It gave the both sides of the argument and left the decision to the public . If the only people 1/2

@deliciousnarry @baimcpher @savvie_j They objectively are . If you get an abortion because you just don ‚Äô t want a baby , you shouldn ‚Äô t have gotten pregnant in the first place .

@washl003 Which I believe is the Word of God . Matt 7:16 , " You will know them by their fruits . " The killing of innocent unborn babies is certainly not Godly fruit . I could give many more examples of Democrats in direct opposition to God's Word if you want , but abortion itself is enough
@MsAvaArmstrong Exactly . Do they want abortion on demand ? Infanticide . Oh sure that would take care of those drug babies ! ‚òπ Ô∏è This is absolutely despicable üò† . FLOTUS is trying to show compassion for drug babies .
Society must switch gears to PREVENTING unwanted pregnancy focusing on morals , values , self esteem & virtuous behavior which will lead to a stronger , self-confident society filled with purpose & achievement ! Abortion is a social & moral disgrace that is PREVENTABLE ! !

@jonkay Slightly off topic here , but I would be interested in how far the Catholic church would extend this policy with politicians ? Justin Trudeau is pro-abortion as is a requirement for his entire caucus , would the Catholic church refuse communion to the entire Liberal caucus ?
I'm pro-choice but if you use abortions like a plan b pill , you're rotten piece of shit laying out in 120 degree weather .

Choosing to have a child torn limb from tiny limb ( of course they'll be careful , so PP can sell the babies body parts ) from your body is one hell of a choice and tells me everything I need to know about you .
does nancy know that schiffty is a russian asset ; actually he has been dating tulsi in an abortion hallway while listening to children being slaughtered . America has come a long way baby
@LoudNProud8 @Madison_Marie75 @KyaeGunn @PPact Also , of course human embryos and fetuses are human . The issue is personhood . On top of that , remember that the Nazis restricted abortion , and most Jews are pro-choice .

@BishopStika 2 / Rick condescendingly notes that Trump reversed HillObama's radical abortion policies , defended religious freedom - all moves that are * * magisterial , * * while Rick's socialism is permitted b / c it's prudential . Bottom line : Rick wants to scoff at us w / his fellow elitists . Sad .
@ilovetacobell @_chhhiii this ! also when i didn ‚Äô t have health insurance , planned parenthood wrote me a script for mine
Shame on a judge ! You can not make someone kill because you think it's ok .
@Arachne646 @ProChoice_HN The point is that when providing stories about space programs , media does not give a platform to the flat earth people . For some reason , when discussing whether women and LGBT have bodily autonomy , they provide a platform to antichoice .

@MatiyuM @scrowder Fair , but the embryo is alive in the same sense that bacteria or weeds are . They can't feel / think . We don't make a big deal when those die . And " pro-life " people stop caring after the birth . They don't care how horrible that child's life may be .

@CaitlinPacific The dishonesty at the core of the ‚Äú debate ‚Äù for me is the willful ignorance of white women to call abortion restrictions what they are : discrimination . When bans or limits are openly and easily navigated by ppl with money and resources , they ‚Äô re a tool of discrimination .

@hollychilek @LeahNTorres Abortion is 100 % healthcare .

@FrancesGruno @lambert_pp I think Scheer was a mistake ; however no one should be forced to march in parade it should not be an issue . Nor should his faith and abortion .

@charliekirk11 I do not understand why Planned Parenthood even receives funding . They do not give free abortions.They have no advertisement cost . Their buildings are paid for.The employees love killing babies , so they should be volunteers . They give D ‚Äô s $ and they get $ It ‚Äô s just quid pro quo .
Yep ! If a fetus is not a human life then neither are you and I .

@Patriotess1976 @amycanham @cincone5 @Cernovich I'm a pro-life conservative but I don't think abortion should be categorically illegal .

Ironic how the same people that complain about ‚Äú overpopulation ‚Äù and that people should stop having children are for banning abortion . Did I also mention that the Democrats won control of the House and State Legislature there ?

@brianlilley @BrianMasseMP @NDP Brian , Scheer didn't lose because of his beliefs ... he lost because people saw him as chameleon .

Joanna Newsom's " Baby Birch " may be the most bone-chilling song about abortion ever written . I pity women who make abortions and end up fucking their own heads torturing themselves in guilt . That makes me despise even more those feminists who try to normalize such brutality .

True . I don't know how I can get along with hateful leftist maniacs who lie and disparage at every turn .
@lifeinthegaps Being prolife should be a non partisan issue . Planned Parenthood made it political by controlling its politicians with $ $ and report cards .

@Mpachol @Zeratoth @VitoGesualdi You said you didn't want any tax dollars going towards it .

@KristineWahl @StupidRock @AmyAddante It ‚Äô s far more important that you can * pretend * your hands are clean , because you didn ‚Äô t think the naughty thoughts about directly ending the pregnancy . That way , you can sanctimoniously oppose abortion , without ever having to inconvenience yourself thinking about the grey zone .
God decides to make you . He lovingly gives one green eyes , pretty teeth , a comical personality , a promising career at a great us university , family with royalty roots and someone goes into your mother's womb and takes your cute little life away from you . Stop abortion NOW !

@Timcast If James started off his stardom by doing something else other than sending in fake hookers and pimps into Planned Parenthood b / c he's a hardliner of the culture war and stuck to issues of substance like this , he wouldn't be so divisive .

@NumbersMuncher The thing I ‚Äô m struggling with is all the pearl clutching over a far left candidate . They can ‚Äô t legislate their unicorn dreams .. which is why we don ‚Äô t have a new Berlin Wall between us and Mexico , abortion still exists , AND we still pay taxes .
Beset by questions over whether his social conservative positions lost Andrew Scheer the election , the Conservative leader is being attacked ...

@socialistmic isn ‚Äô t that part of the point tho ? there are all these existing kids in a super fucked up system and fixing that / providing the right resources to their parents doesn ‚Äô t seem to matter to anti choice people
a wonderful meeting of producer @gutobrinholi with Ambassador of Hungary for the Holy See , @EduardHabsburg , presenting the LEBE magazine , edited by the " Movement for Life SouthTyrol " we all Choose Life ! üëá
Paul George is really with the woman he was trying to pay off to have an abortion üòÇ he tried & failed then the happy family ending happened
@OnstadWalter @BrittPettibone Your thinking is correct , but you don't take into account the fact that the pro-choice league is importing members . Also , I'm pro choice politically and personally , because abortion isn't coercion and if my wife has a malformed fetus I'll abort it .
Kentucky just lost their ever loving minds ! ! ! God Help Them ! KY Gov
Planned Parenthood will receive ~ $ 500 Million in Medicare payments this year .
@PPFA Abortion = murder
