@mileslunn @Tyler_Lalonde__ There is no rights in Charter to abortion , same-sex marriage , no death penalty .

Wanjiku was sexually violated by an older man in her village and became pregnant . With no access to safe abortion services , she was forced to turn to a fraudulent “ doctor ” who botched the procedure which later resulted in her death in June 2018 at just 18 yrs old Keep Wanjiku Safe

So , how do you feel about abortion ? Is it about a woman's right to choose what happens to their bodies , ergo personal freedom and liberty ? Or about the right to life for an unborn child ? That will determine how you feel about this story . abortion Pro Life prochoice
Sounds like a serial killer to me . Just uses the title " MD " .
The last two days have proven why the pro-life movement left me . What passes for leadership--mainstream , mind you--is willing to condone the most despicable and underhanded tactics and people in the name of defending the sanctity of life .
As long as abortion is legal , men will think it ’ s okay to kill their child even when the mother says no . Abortion isn ’ t about choice . It ’ s about making the baby pay with its life when the mother or father doesn ’ t “ want ” it . Moral Laws must protect life !
It is sad that the Senate would make animal cruelty a felony . I do not disagree . BUT why did they continue to ignore abortion as murder ? That should be a felony !

@jenniferbeing @goodhood61 @MaryMargOlohan @DailyCaller @RepUllman That's the crux of the debate . If abortion is a moral good , then there must be a benefit to both the parties involved : the mother and the child being killed . You advocate for killing the child to benefit the mother . How does killing her child benefit her . Legality =/ = morality

@pennyarnie @spicymuffins89 @RitaPanahi Your take on this chart is completely wrong . These figures account for the whole pregnancy cycle . If the baby is fully developed up to 8 months , aborting has a higher probability of maternal death than giving birth . Plus , the probability of child death in abortion is 100 % .

@Whiteeagle1a @funder ... greatly reduces unwanted pregnancies AND the abortion rate ; in Colorado it went down 40 % in one year . We've tried to stop people from having sex for 6,000 years . It's never worked . Let's try something that does . By reducing unwanted pregnancies , we'll also save on welfare .

@Kenzie_Bre @madis__ @baimcpher CDC statistics report that around 66 % of abortions are done during the first 8 weeks - an abortion pill is used during the first 9 weeks . So at least 66 % are done by the pill which induces miscarriage -

Actually statistics show that the opposite is true . When women go through pregnancy / motherhood they ’ re more likely to become pro-choice because they recognize how difficult it can be and would only want women who WANT IT to go through it .

Wednesday Thoughts why would she be charged with murder if the baby in the womb is nothing but a cluster of cells and not a human life why is it legal for planned parenthood to kill babies in the womb of a woman these are himan babies and shouldnt be murder prolife
@1984alt1 @Madchen110 @DanaSchwartzzz @birbigs Not true . And I don ’ t know what side you think I am on , I am middle ground liberal . Just think Nationalism is the remit of the feeble minded , though we may be talking about two different types of nationalism . I was just reading some of your tweets on abortion and asked a question .

I can enumerate all of the factors that make abortion NOT “ pro-life ” but you all are not ready for that discussion so good morning na lang ☕ ️
thats a . 0005 % chance of any of those happening . not sure how you can get much safer than that . sounds like pretty grear “ women ’ s healthcare ” .
@DonnaLohrer @cher I ’ m going to pull out all of the stops to get President Trump re-elected .

@PatriotRains That's right . Black communities have poor schools , but you can bet our communities have top of the line abortion clinics . When we're doing well ( working and paying our way ) Democrats consider it an affront.If they care about black people , why don't they celebrate when we do well ?

I have a question for you . How is it that people who advocate open borders unlimited migration and refugees are the same people telling us that we are overpopulated , don't get pregnant and if you do get an abortion , control our population ? OK now . What are their motives ?
@pixelprotectors It'll take me weeks to read what he compiled . An awesome pro-life champion .
Here is abortion : A house is burning with a woman and child inside . The rescue team can ’ t save the woman , but if they save the child it will probably end up in foster care and most likely grow up in poverty . Should the child burn to death instead ?
@godless_doc That choice in itself would be a victory for all of us because we all know the anti-choicers don't fight fair .
How do you , as a woman , base your alleged “ pretty vagina ” on the fact that you haven ’ t birthed kids , had an abortion , and / or have intercourse with many partners ? Internalized misogyny aside , what the fuck ?

This is crazy . And then states want to ban abortion so that poor women who already can ’ t afford the cost of raising a child have to go into medical debt to give birth to a child they didn ’ t want to have . Make it make sense 🥴 .
This is to say nothing , of course , of the well documented history of forced abortion outside America , especially in CCP-controlled China . Can pro-choice and pro-life people at least agree to vigorously oppose forced abortion as a basic human rights issue ?
@__Helicon__ ' Pro-Life ' is a misnomer . It should be called ' Pro-Birth ' . All these fanatics want is for the child to be born . Once delivered , they don't give a damn if it's fed , clothed , sheltered . They prove this by protesting choice , but not objecting to homeless , starving and sick children .

@psufan68 I couldn ’ t care less that Ms . Ragsdale is a lesbian . However , the existence of the “ National Abortion Federation ” is disgusting . That she is identified as a “ Christian leader ” is likewise appalling . Ms . Ragsdale considers abortionists “ heroes ” and abortion “ a blessing ” . Pure evil
@RadioFreeTom @ReginaldALawso1 This time it's not about abortion or Socialism . It's about racism : somehow stopping the coming non-white majority . That's their priority . And they see this as their last chance to try .
Despite Court Meddling , Ohio Passes Laws to Protect the Unborn - Abortion Is Murder
@MadMatt_G @stclairashley I agree . It's the insidious way the left manipulates words to mean whatever they want them to mean . First it was reproductive " rights " . Then reproductive rights got thrown into the " healthcare " umbrella . So now they're trying to say abortion is health care . It's sickening .

Your views on the bible , abortion , homosexuality , politics , etc . don't readily classify you as Jesus ' disciples . The way they treat PEOPLE with LOVE is how His true followers are recognized .
Here's how " Freedom of Conscience " almost cost someone their life , @UCP In Washington State , a hospital with religious restrictions . , avoided telling a woman with a life-threatening pregnancy that an abortion was an option . ableg abpoli yyc
@NOUVEAUXDEBUTS @SteveKornacki Doubt it , too . A close 2nd to abortion is the " socialism " tact . I don't know if you live in KY , but the GOP ads in nearly every race here have incorporated the trigger words " socialism " and " radical " & shown pics of AOC & Bernie . Also , a sprinkle of Hillary here and there .
@bryantheblue @redsteeze @TianaTheFirst People at the highest levels of corporations are really apolitical . They only side with the party that will benefit them and their corporation most . Billionaires don't care about abortion , police brutality , immigration or whatever . They care about money and which party will give
Abortion is never a need but a selfish decision of convenience ending up without an exception in murder .
@AnnieKNK It ’ s this weird schizophrenic relationship to death and bodies where like We ’ re obsessed with them ( euthanasia , abortion , libertinism , pornography ) but can ’ t deal with them as integral wholes .
@BjPerrarre @mary_sorensen @joostverhoef @cwwhite212 The conversation started with some bishops saying opposition to abortion should not be designated the “ preeminent ” priority for the church in the U .

@lifeinthegaps It's the same with varying faiths , or lack thereof . Anyone can be Pro-life . The idea , the movement , doesn't belong to any one group . We are all capable of using logic to inform our morality . We are all capable of seeing that Science supports the Right to Life .
@laurenduca I love the Libs who demonize the NRA . The same group who's member's have never been involved in a criminal shooting with the LEGAL firearms . A group who has the same right to exist as CAIR , NAACP , or planned parenthood . If we get rid of one let's get rid of them all .

@DLeibowitzAU @thechaeburger @RitaPanahi Yes , it ’ s the logical fallacy you proposed by asking for definition of murder , which is a way to dismiss the argument that denying abortion is denying medical care . Abortion IS medical care . The ethics of medical care apply . As in , if it ’ s needed , it should be accessible .
" This clear affront to providing comprehensive , accessible sexual and reproductive care will do much more than restrict abortion . As prevention and treatment services diminish under the Title X restrictions , this country can expect higher rates of STDs "

' Sexual and reproductive health are matters of fundamental human rights - and they are critical for women's , children's and adolescents ' health ' . There shouldn't be any argument on this .
@amagrammie @ArchKennedy @LifeNewsHQ @LifeSite You ’ re exactly right . The last pro-life Democrat , Governor Casey , was shabbily treated by his own party in the 90s for being pro-life .
@wilroache @NickKouvalis Exactly Scheer is getting a black face from trolls and liberal hacks and news media bs .. Muslim invasion-intrusion and all of a sudden being Catholic is a threat-or being pro-life instead of a hit man for abortion-OMG who ’ s Mad 👹

@Sarxis @QLover18 @EvanAKilgore I also never said long term abortion should be acceptable ? Or I would ’ ve said that clearly . I personally don ’ t feel a pregnancy passed 2-3 months should be legal . Don ’ t flip my words around
For all the idiots claiming it's time to leave Scheer alone , this is exactly what would happen . Women are not dumb . We understand what is at stake & see what the anti-choice movement is doing , working in lock-step with Cons across the country .

@stefan_stefanw @demosucker @RepAdamSchiff I agree with you , Planned Parenthood should be able to kill babies with impunity and they shouldn ’ t be able to lobby their murderous practices to democrats

@andy_eyes_72 @CBCPolitics Agreed . For many , but not all . My position shifted when I look at the evidence . In fact most pro-life people I know hold their position based on evidence .
The Bible clearly states that insuring the end times mankind will not know right from wrong and we are clearly seeing it from the party of satan ... the left !
@SOCKSnFLOPS Technically I shouldn't answer this since I was beat a lot growing up , but aside from that I didn't want to be a teen parent ( or a parent at all ) like my parents and also good friends who took me to Planned Parenthood and paid for my abortion . Still love and appreciate them !

@tariwemadimples True , the circumstances under which abortion is deemed legal should be broadened . The number of incidents where young pregnant girls commit suicide or die after unsafe procedures is actually increasing because girls are not fully empowered to make decisions regarding their bodies

so basically in a nutshell . no pun intended . if i can ’ t force you to have an abortion then you also can ’ t force me to raise a child i didn ’ t want . how we got pregnant isn ’ t important . you ’ re pregnant now and the question in hand is the child .

@SwissMissDaw She closed her mind na that abortion could be an option for some women . It isn't always about religion nor your culture . Take Catriona's answer for example : " I'm for its medical use but not so for recreational use . " hayyy . She is still strong though .

@mypalfish @EsotericCD @AndrewYang On the topic of abortion , there are some pretty strong pro-lifers in the YangGang because they see Yang's UBI as the most effective pro-life policy imaginable . It becomes quite clear when you realize 75 % of all women who get an abortion are lower class income or in poverty .
The goal of the Left's entire agenda , including abortion , climate change , gay marriage , transgender mania , sex dolls , contraception , divorce , gender identity , etc ? A smaller population .
Also another reminder that GOP & Trump ARE NOT PRO-LIFE ! ! !

@FredRevived @LeahNTorres Possessing agency grants one unconditional control over one's self . It's that simple . There are many parallels to abortion where agency is exercised and there is no issue . Eg : a pregnant person can refuse medical treatment - resulting in her death .
If she reads from the Bible ! Matthew 18:6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea .

@notcapnamerica @littlebusted 30 , but the state went red in every other major race . It's more of an indication of how horrible Bevin is than the state as a whole going blue . Very much driven by abortion and guns . I'll stay hopeful , but there's a lot more work to do .

All health dept . offer free birth control . But only PP offers the murder of babies for women who won't get birth control . It's very inexpensive to use the pill or a IUD then you don't have to worry about murdering a precious baby .

@jordie_nassif @NCEquestrian @ACaitlyn14 In the cases I ’ ve heard of ( one of the physicians I work with used to be at one of the top women ’ s hospitals in the country ) , it ’ s not abortion to save the mom , it ’ s doing a c-section to save the mom when the baby is barely viable , which often leads to the baby dying .

For all those who support abortion . Is it ok to abort a child because it is a boy or a girl ? Folks in India have aborted 1.5 million babies because they were female . Just courious . You want a boy and so you abort the girl .

@SonnyTheGreat_ The goverment Funding planned parenthood is Big government
A woman ’ s ability to access comprehensive sexuality education , control her own body , and access the health services she needs — regardless of her sexuality , where she lives , her income level , or her ethnicity — is a fundamental human right .

@dannyt0m @Pro_life_ANCAP @blu_feminist @Godisgood1836 @dylanmattress Yeah , I can ’ t see the tweet from a blocked account . So you have yet another Alex P ? I had the . Other put in twitter jail and this one will follow . Good to know . Reported and blocked .
@jdnaa @iamamadrunner @djclimenhaga Do you think pro choice people are advocating for everyone to get abortions ? ? Pro choice is advocating for a woman ’ s right to choose what happens to her . No one of getting forced abortions . But also no one is getting forced childbirth / children . Why should you get to decide ?
At the time of their last meeting , the parishioner had challenged Klopfer , saying , “ George , it ’ s not too late . You are like the thief on the cross next to Jesus . You belong to Jesus , George , accept that , even in the last hour , accept that . ”
Doing so , strips the liberty that they obtained by fighting the patriarchy . It is sexist against women to have a biological man completing against them . Where is the feminist push back ? Is their fight limited to promoting abortion so that men can have consequence-free sex ?

@LexieLouhooo @BellonaRevived And yet , I guarantee you ’ ve spent little to no time trying to understand the Pro-Choice side . How do I know ? Because ( again ) I was raised in a pro-life community . I know what we were taught to think and believe about abortion .
Planned parenthood saves thousands of women ’ s lives every day . I had a pregnancy scare in high school after I was raped . They tested me FOR FREE offered me counseling FOR FREE and gave me a year supply of birth control FOR FREE ! PP is a safe haven for women and girls all over 💯 🗣

@PointScot @ShireenQudosi Only Gabbard was willing to pose any restrictions on abortion and she got a lot of hate for it . None of the other candidates put restrictions on it , meaning they supported them up until the 9th month of pregnancy
I'd have to say it's much more a case of Catholic anti-Canadian bigotry . They are not just opposed to Catholic women getting birth control or abortions , they are opposed to ALL women having the choice . They want to impose their beliefs on ALL CANADIANS ! !

A deep dive into three anti-abortion organizations and their anti-science research used to write abortion laws . Missouri ’ s “ expert ” witness in the Planned Parenthood hearing , Dr . Donna Harrison , is associated with two of the the organizations .
As a clinic escort , I've seen abortion in a unique way - as an issue of fundamental human dignity . It isn't an intractable political fight ; it has been made into one by those who seek to undermine pregnant people's humanity . Supporting abortion means supporting people . That's it .
@AbbyJohnson @yoalexrapz This is a very good emotional argument against abortion . Another emotional argument is a woman ’ s bodily autonomy ... you ’ re taking it away . Also , sounds like we can expect you to promote sex ed and many forms of birth control , and the morning after pill . We can agree on some stuff
@ewarren Abortions shouldn't be used as birth control . About 95 % or more of abortion are because the parents don't want the baby . Only about 2 % are yo save the mothers life . A baby shouldn't be murdered because it's parents were irresponsible dumb asses . Birth control is easy .

“ If your rich - abortion is legal ” “ Abortion access becomes a class issue ” ICPD25 panelists share realities from the ground that highlight differential impacts of abortion restrictions : poor women face complications and death from lack of access to safely provided abortion
@LynneFo36961689 But it is true . Project Veritas ha filmed undercover , some of the high ups in planned Parenthood and documented them talking about selling b4by parts and how they deliver them to keep what they're selling intact .
@feistybunnygirl @Danofran Probirth , not pro-life
Joe Biden denied Holy Communion Tiny Lives At Stake Pro Life PJNET COS Project This is long overdue
@maman_de_isla @baimcpher And this is the logic that most woman means pro choice does not mean pro abortion
@RadicalGoats @LeahNTorres That's a stillbirth , not an abortion . 2 completely different things . At 8 months one is tragic and the other is murder .
@Legendary_Ice @LeahNTorres And also risk the lives of women to this dangerous procedure .
@kawashima_ami_ @TheRedColonista Bruh Yes Christian yes I believe in god and stuff but my actions and life style aren ’ t influenced by religion abortion was just one heck of an interesting subject It wasn ’ t really my intention to go this deep in the religious aspect heh ...
@shadesofoffside She's using the same sort of logic anti-choice folks use .

@tweettruth2me You nailed it . He views me as a subject and not a citizen . California ’ s elected representatives do not believe in individual liberty unless you are talking about a 13 year old getting an abortion without parental notice or a prisoner that wants to transgender .
I look at current mainstream leadership with pity — we are not getting anywhere meaningful because we are not listening to the needs of BIPOC ProLife Movement has reduced black / brown people to stats , cautionary tails and tokenized into “ look we are diverse ”
Who votes for morons like Ted Cruz ? School kids are getting shot on a daily basis , yet he talks about religious fanatics and how we should protect them and reject woman's right to choose . Santa Clarita

@brianc1959 I don't care . My governor just made a huge strategic chess move in order to keep his seat , despite being the best governor we've had in decades . He gambled with my daughter and my reproductive rights ... and I honestly don't think it's going to pay off . Those devil's bargains .
@ScottFordTVGuy NO ! This is no longer the Democrat party from 20 years ago or even 10 years ago . They are completely ruled by radical leftists , identity politics , unfettered abortion activists , illegal immigration activists . America is last with them , not first .
@Bluebir51334621 Some of us find abortion distressing too .

The grin 😄 😄 😄 on my face when the Mexico City Policy's namesake had a representative telling us that Abortion before 12 weeks is now legal there ! I can't wait till we wave goodbye to the Global Gag Rule
Me : gets asked to be on a panel by a respected organization to talk about the innovative work we ’ re doing in Texas for abortion access Also me : immediately brings up my dog and how much I love him 😂 😂 🐶

Congratulations to reproductive rights advocate , Senator-elect @Hashmi4Va on her victory in Virginia ’ s 10th Senate District , challenging anti-choice incumbent Glen Sturtevant , who narrowly won his district in 2015
President Trump is the most pro-life president our nation has ever seen . He and his administration have secured victory after victory for unborn children and their mothers – appointing pro-life judges , stopping taxpayer funding of abortion at home and abroad ...

When she found out her daughter planning to have an abortion , a woman called Schenectady campaign leader Viviane to ask what could be done . Despite setbacks , the woman called Viviane again--this time to tell her that her daughter and the father had decided to keep the baby !
X adil ! The author , muslim Maryam Lee , is now being targeted and accused unjustly of anti-Islam sentiment simply for choosing to write about the long journey it took for her to decide to be hijab-free . Hijab-free does not mean anti-Islam ! If hijab isnt a choice , it is oppression !
You obviously are not a girl , or woman , neither are you your sisters keeper . Women Sexual Reproductive Rights are Human Rights . Get off your high horse and listen , learn and then advocate for no girl or woman to be left behind when it comes to her rights . Its rights not rubbish .
@aidnmclaughlin @brianstelter Pro Life Only Some Matter
Pro-choice advocates demonize Christians for their pro-life stances , have you ever thought about why they do not attack Islam for their extreme view of abortion ? Stay tuned , I have a gem for you .
" In a recent fundraiser for Planned Parenthood , drag queen performers in Washington state mocked pro-life activists and local Christian pastors by auctioning off cardboard cutouts of their faces , mimicking a slave-style auction . "
@Laverne19228030 @InjuredAlex @allisonccox @mkt293 @DrSteveJacobs @dylrschn @LeahNTorres At 28 I knew I'd rather die than carry an unwanted pregnancy . Fortunately , I didn't have toake that choice because abortion was available .
@PPFA If you can spend that much money on fighting Trump then why are you getting subsidized by tax payers every year ?
@gsamu53 @jmksd @BIZPACReview They both like abortion - don't know where they stand on infanticide but we know what is going to happen in Virginia !

@realJoshuaHall @ShockaJilly @TulsiGabbard John Podesta bankrolled Tulsi's Congress bid ( per Wikileaks emails ) Tulsi was CFR , She voted for 3rd term abortion , she voted for impeachment but refuses to call Biden's Corruption . Her exploitation of wearing a uniform is nauseating . Just another crazy Dem .
Unproven and unethical . The doctor should lose his license . @ACOGAction
Ben Shapiro went on an unprompted hissy fit about how opposing Mass Immigration system is racist , yet treats a question that included a prompt about how Abortion is fine because it kills people more likely to be poor people like it ’ s a respectable view to have .
He wanted more Epstein ’ s for spare body parts and adrenochrome that his body wouldn ’ t reject . They were “ farming babies and the slaves are all working ” “ I ’ m going hungry ” planned parenthood selling baby bodies getting subsidies make $ 500 million worth of socialist sense now ?
@Maxxflyy @TondoDominic @ewarren Well if you want to punish women for being pregnant by taking away their option to have an abortion what is the punishment for the men that helped them get pregnant . Since men are helping to make the decision do women get to make the decision on the punishment for men . Castration

@An3ita5 Love to see us use pro / anti choice , words matter . 💙
@Digidiva2018 @SidneyPowell1 Frankly , it is hard to fathom how Christians of all races and ethnicities can ’ t see the importance of Trump ’ s efforts to uphold core values materially important to all Christians . Besides the pro-life virtues , there are so many other accomplishments that are pro-Christian .
U re mocking single mothers simply because ur abortion was successful ko . Wehdon awon murderer 🏃 🏃 🏃
@DavidJHarrisJr @MarkDice @kanyewest The Black Church sold out to the Democrat Party during the Civil Rights Era . Criticizing abortion would piss off their White / Jewish liberal handlers .
