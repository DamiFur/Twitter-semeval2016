@ItJiiggles Lol you're saying I'm using strawman arguments but you literally got my entire point wrong . I dont think anyone should be forced to give an abortion . Like I said , you can choose a field in medicine that doesnt involve abortions or choose a different profession .
@Squirrel_City_ @HannahM_Writes @Woofaraw @CChiffley @LeahNTorres Obviously you can care about more than one thing at a time , but I never seem to hear the pro-life crowd advocating for universal healthcare or increased social programs or comprehensive sex ed--even though those would all reduce the number of abortions .

Media just harps on this every time saying conservatives are anti-choice and anti-women . Do they never get tired of the lies . There is no way abortion would be abolished . Most conservatives are fiscal conservatives who want to manage economy better not social conservatives .

@trooney184 @brent_peabody Nah . Like most things , making abortions illegal and defunding Planned Parenthood makes abortions more common . This is good news all around , especially for fetuses and newborns .
The problem with the pro-life movement is it's not willing to pay a cost . Freedom is costly . Are you willing to sacrifice ? Are you willing to stand in between the victims and the powers that be for this cause ? If you could see the victims every day would it change your approach ?

@peytnhaag A large amount of those who are prolife adopt . Luckily all newborns do get adopted according to statistics . With that being said , you would never allow a newborn to be killed just because the mother doesn ‚Äô t want them . Because death isn ‚Äô t a solution . I refuse to ignore any abuse .
Killing unwanted newborns is a problem ... but free abortion isnt lmaooo . Yall are clowns . Abortions are allowed ... at the lowest maximum of 13 weeks . And many places , as late as 24 weeks . Yall are MENTALLY UNSTABLE . Google what a baby looks like at these weeks in pregnancy .

@actually_q Girl the guy made the baby without anyone forcing him . Everyone , even more the doc knows what could happen when you have unprotected sex . Some people believe abortion is wrong and trying to make people do something that they are against is cruel .
Because @GregAbbott_TX and the rest of them were NEVER Christian or Pro Life they make sure those in need are out of sight and throw them away when necessary

Anyone can get an abortion for any reason . Can't afford to take care of a kid ? Abortion . Raped ? Abortion . Will the baby kill you if you give birth to it ? Abortion . Do you just not want kids ? Abortion .
Abortion is demonic . Period . In all ways , in all stages , for any reason . Supporting it and ignoring it are both evil .
@muchaz45 @wanjirukihusa Maternal health is not only about abortion . Expand your knowledge
Ridiculous .

@JJHTweets This is completely wrong , they are a democratic pro-choice party supporting a second vote . Please don't misrepresent them . I've admired your work for some time but you've got this wrong . They want to bring people together rather than setting Remainers against Leavers .
@USCCB - Catholics faithful to the Magisterium of the Holy Catholic Church and to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ demanded that you release the names of the 69 bishops that by their vote indicated that abortion is not an important issue of focus .

Neil Macdonald : Andrew Scheer is effectively pro-choice , why not just own it ? : Opinion | CBC News
@SabrinaMalhi @DrJenGunter How often do abortions over 6 months happen ? Please remember anencephaly is but one of the diagnoses that may result in abortion . There's a whole host of things that can go wrong , and they account for pretty much all of the abortions carried out that late in a pregnancy .
So the Catholic Church refuses communion to Biden because he is pro-choice . A little ironic with all of their scandals , but ok . Let he who is without sin cast the first stone . Last I checked , Jesus loved Mary Magdalene , but whatever ...

@She_Brings_Joy @LilMotherHooker @Sam_DeLoach I ‚Äô m aware there were stated with legal abortions .

@eorlins @MotherJones Well said . You can be personally against abortion , but still be for woman making their own choices about their bodies .

@kathykattenburg @LibSelfOwns @NRO @xan_desanctis I get your point . However when some lawmakers changed abortion laws it is completely within the realm of possibilities that some doctors don't see that as healthcare . Not what they signed up for 20 years ago .

@Leo97894180 @HobbsProlife She also implies that we support abortion as a solution to the rape ... Um , no . It ‚Äô s a solution to the unwanted pregnancy that was caused by a rapist . It has to be willful ignorance to not see the relationship between rape and banning abortion .
Just because abortion is not an option for your situation does not mean it isn't for someone else . No one and I mean no one knows what others are going through and or has been through to make that difficult decision
@ProphetWalrus Yes , I know , it says that the lives of the marginalized are equally sacred to those of the unborn . It does not say that abortion is a social crime equal to others . It is perfectly legitimate to hold that abortion is worthy of special attention , without ignoring other crimes .

@NBCNews You support them coming here at will and murdering , raping , and all kinds of other crimes in American soil ; also you support abortion , so save your pathetic rhetoric now !
@BillyHallowell True . We have one party openly hostile to the pro-life issue and the other which continues to fund Planned Parenthood in every spending / budget bill that is passed and signed .
Maybe I'll move to Ohio
It matters in Virginia . Republicans are prolife . If we don ‚Äô t , the General Assembly will pass an infanticide bill allowing babies to be killed after birth ! We do not want to be like NY ! College students VOTE . It matters 2 the babies Vote Pro Life vote Red2019 prolifegeneration
Remember : When debating a Pro-Abortion advocate , their only tool is to use your own standards of truth against you . They don't actually believe in objective truth , so every objective premise they use is just a ploy . They're simply trying to confuse you to get their way .
@BellonaRevived Ha ! First of all , you're EXTREMELY wrong . I don't think you could be any more wrong . Second of all , I think we should stop abortion before we put immigrant children in the womb at risk for abortion . Third of all , there have actually been pro life organizations that donated
Gamers , its N7 day , celebrating the mass effect games . What to EA do for the occasion ? Give you the chance to BUY mass effect themed skins for their biggest flop in recent history ... like theres anyone still playing that fucking abortion of a game ! !

When the system we have forces workers to justify something as basic as affordable healthcare & insurance , it's hard to argue for much more . Why am I adamantly pro-choice ? Because it reflects the value we put on an American Citizen's basic autonomy & decision making .

@RepJayapal Just wondering about the rights of Melissa Ogden and Gianna Jessen ... Both women . Both survivors of attempted abortion . Human rights ? How about Human Rights of Unborn Children ? Maybe more research needed . [ p . s . There is help and hope for post-abortive men and women . ]

Aside from the doubtful numbers given for deaths from illegal abortions , my problem with this what it omits . I ‚Äô m so tired of the fact that this debate rests on an idea that the right to sex is more important than the right to live , a premise that is never itself argued for .
The proposal would criminalize abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy , before many women realize they are pregnant .

Yup . Still happening . I've cut out church completely ' though I was never taken in by some of the crazy teachings in the RC church . Like the pro-life idiots who condone the death penalty . I've concluded , religion is a cult . You're right . Lots of clueless ppl in these red states .
@RepMarkMeadows @GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump Very prayerful says the woman who is pro abortion . Pretty sure God doesn't care for liars and killing babies Pelosi your a hypocrite .

@GovernorKayIvey Hi superstitious ignorant hicks , your constant attempts to control women will not work , now or 10 years from now .
Lack of access to contraception is a major barrier to girls ' empowerment and their access to education , employment and income . At @AFD_en , we believe sexual and reproductive rights are the 1st condition for equality between women and men . ICPD25 Nairobi Summit
Democrats projected to flip Virginia Senate and House , taking control of state government for the first time in a generation
These are sick people . People who believe in sky fairies and myths and think they have a right to tell women what to do !
@taymomo5 @dotdotcarissa @p0ppysead @baimcpher It makes no sense to think that way . My mom had me when she was 15 . If she had gotten an abortion there are other kids who would be alive today instead of me because her life would have gone much differently . Did she deny them life by having me ?
It ‚Äô s hilarious to me how many women say things like ‚Äú I would NEVER , not in one billion years , even if I was raped at gunpoint , get an abortion , I just think other people should be able to choose to ‚Äù I ‚Äô m not even saying abortion should be outlawed bc it ‚Äô s a super complex issue BUT

@LiveAction This is blood money and defines gross in not only goods eyes but in any humans eyes these holy innocents deserve a burrow the proper way but planned parenthood must repent for their sins which call to the heavens for God justice may god save these children in jesus name
Heaven has gates and not everyone gets in . Jesus would also be against abortion and told people to keep their own money . Jesus is the farthest thing from people like Bernie
I am a devout pro-life Catholic and this sickens me . How do we expect someone to turn from sin when we deny them the unity with Christ that could actually change them from the inside out ? Yes , abortion is unthinkable , but Jesus taught us to love the sinner and hate the sin .

Going to prison for providing sex education ? The EU says no ! Today the @Europarl_EN denounced a Polish draft law that criminalises sex education . This law is yet another attack on sexual and reproductive rights in Poland . Unacceptable and against our European values !
prolife saying that women ‚Äô s bodies aren ‚Äô t theirs when pregnant shows how little they care for women or see them as people . It ‚Äô s a way for them to try and exert control over women . If they had their way , they would chain every woman down to ensure they gave birth . prochoice
As an Alberta doctor I am disgusted that this is being proposed in our province Bill207 puts health care worker's belief systems above patient rights and will serve to reduce access for those most vulnerable in our province : women , LGBTQ , end of life , rural / remote
The courts have disgracefully been protecting Planned Parenthood against state laws enacted to protect women . Let's pray this court does the right thing !

@amandadeibert Reproductive healthcare , mostly on the infertility side ( what proper diagnosis and treatment look like , access to affordable IVF ) , but also on the pro-choice side . Also , air disasters .
Republicans aren't going to impeach Trump unless he has a late term abortion .
@BishopBarron @USCCB Bishops for their part need to be courageous & faithful . Stand for the faith . When a pro-abortion official steps up for the Eucharist , support the priest who says no . When a dissenting priest promotes LGBT pride , discipline him . When the pope & Cardinals teach error , correct them
Dude's obviously never tried to walk into an abortion clinic .

Confederacy : VA went all in last night , and yes ! when the Governor wants abortion to include children who survive a botched abortion , and majority of abortions are with black babies , then please ... don't let immigrants know they just voted for ' white power '
Defunding Planned Parenthood reduces access to contraception and other necessary health care . In 2011 , the Texas Legislature cut the two-year budget for funding family planning in an effort to defund Planned Parenthood .

@cmclymer @Kate_Kelly_Esq I ‚Äô m reminded that Ruth Bader Ginsberg , as a young lawyer working on abortion rights , was upset that Row established the legality of abortion based on privacy rather than the equality of women . I hope she will see that equality enshrined in the Constitution very soon .
@NewYorkStateAG Do you really have a J . D . ( law degree ) ? ? Where in the Constitution does it mention reproductive ‚Äù rights ? ‚Äù I must have missed it . The 14th Amendment does however state , ‚Äù ... nor shall any State deprive any person of LIFE , liberty , or property , without due process of law ... ‚Äù
Of course , complications may arise , but they can be well prevented when the process is done by a qualified person , not quacks . And we are not saying abortion by drinking seven up and salt of whatever it is we hear commonly . Our customs wont just allow the thing to be legalised .

- it is wrong to imply that access to medical services ( especially abortion and MAID ) is not an issue in this day and age . it is - including in Alberta . we need FEWER barriers , not more .
Even as a GOP white male evangelical for years , I wasn't an asshole ( I don't think ) . I occasionally voted Dem , was always pro-choice even being anti-abortion . Was always pro-lgbt rights . It's hard for me to understand the level of asshole my former party has gone to this decade .
Oh , yes . I ‚Äô ll still give donations to individual candidates . Also , when the Republicans funded Planned Parenthood in their budget , I sent my former donation times 10 to a pro-life crisis pregnancy ministry that helps women & babies rather than to the RNC .

@becgop @funnythin @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump He also cheated on his pregnant wife with a prostitute . I'm sure he would have paid for her abortion . Wake up .
Republicans say they are pro life , but only for the fetus . Life encompasses so much more than conception . What happens after birth is more important . Healthcare , education , clean air and water are very important , too .
@Not_OvaryActing @animadiscordia @HobbsProlife How the hell is Heather comparing rape to abortion when ~ one of the two ~ is consensual . Having an abortion was NOT like being raped all over again , imo .
@MyFaithVotes People including priests don't want to preach Hell , Fire , & Brimstone anymore . But they kind of need to sometimes . People need to realize just how seriously wrong abortion is . And how seriously important it is to obey the 10 commandments .

I think my favorite thing is when self claimed ‚Äú prolifers ‚Äù comment and stalk every single one of my posts thinking they ‚Äô re ‚Äú correct ‚Äù in any form . The fact that they don ‚Äô t follow me and go out or their way to comment on all of my new posts immediately is just sad , prochoice
@michaelmalice It ‚Äô s akin to thinking left wing politicians want tax payer funded abortion on demand solely because of planned parenthood .

lol I see the Internet didn ‚Äô t change without me . Gay married , pro-choice , pro weed legalization , for reforming prisons , for public education and anti-war is now conservative . Conservative is the New Liberal , coming to Netflix soon ! ( Also I think I was 12 in this pic . )
my dad and I differ in some of our social / political views but he is pro choice and doesn ‚Äô t care too much about me dancing which is pretty good for a boomer honestly

It ‚Äô s not offensive . It ‚Äô s stupid bc sex doesn ‚Äô t mean your vagina is less intact ... neither does have a kid or an abortion . You just wanted to say you have a pretty pussy sis ...

@maxfawcett @tim4hire @Citizen004 @danicamclellan @DonBraid It is not a same day service arrangements can be made to go to a bigger town if necessary . Why is it we fight for pro choice but then try to take the choice away from doctors . In emergency I agree and feel then there should be compelling law to make doctors comply in emergency

I'm " anti-inequality on abortion too " . I . e . if a woman has a choice of parenthood after pregnancy ( several of them in fact ) the man should have it too .
@baimcpher This tweet is dumb and holds no real logic , you don ‚Äô t have a chance to get that attached before an abortion , if you knew anything about pregnancy then you would know the ‚Äú ultrasounds ‚Äù and ‚Äú kicks ‚Äù don ‚Äô t happen until waaay into your pregnancy .

@MattWalshBlog Matt are you ok ? You ‚Äô re tweeting like a leftist moving the goal post on abortion .

@buffsblg Places like Planned Parenthood would ‚Äô ve aborted the baby without reporting to police and allowed the father to continue to abuse her .

@CindyKendrick11 Is it too late for abortion ?
Next time a ‚Äú friend tells you they are a Christian & a Democrat ask them this : Which political party supports sacrificing babies to Satan ? Women please don ‚Äô t believe the PC crap that abortion is a healthcare ...
Created Equal believes Black Lives Matter . That ‚Äô s because they understand black mothers are targeted by planned parenthood and ‚Äú abortion services ‚Äù the most . Black babies are killed far more than any other race to abortion . It ‚Äô s very sad !
SC ‚Äô s heartbeat abortion ban heads to Senate floor , now with exceptions for rape , incest This is still a horrible piece of legislation .
