@CBSNews conservatives : don ’ t get an abortion , put your kids up for adoption ! ! ! also conservatives : LGBTQUIA couples shouldn ’ t be allowed to adopt said kids we don ’ t want you to abort , because we are hypocritical cunts who aren ’ t decent human beings but are bible humpers .
@ItJiiggles Lol you're saying I'm using strawman arguments but you literally got my entire point wrong . I dont think anyone should be forced to give an abortion . Like I said , you can choose a field in medicine that doesnt involve abortions or choose a different profession .
@Squirrel_City_ @HannahM_Writes @Woofaraw @CChiffley @LeahNTorres Obviously you can care about more than one thing at a time , but I never seem to hear the pro-life crowd advocating for universal healthcare or increased social programs or comprehensive sex ed--even though those would all reduce the number of abortions .

@kiwinerd NB is only province to not fund clinic abortions . Clinic554 provides abortion & reproductive health care to all who need it , including trans & non-binary folks . It has made a huge difference to queer & trans folk . Health authority & govt are indifferent or hostile .

Here's my second article on Northern Ireland's recent legal changes regarding abortion . This post focuses on the debate itself . bothlivesmatter
@EastSideTea @KrisRHoyt @Downeyangel @ahaacksucks @LeahNTorres People break leases all the time , pancake . Landlords ( or , any landlord I've rented from or been privy to through my employment ) charge one month rent for breaking the lease and let it go . Abortion terminates said undesirable lease . Mine was $ 500 when I had it . 😎
“ You can ’ t self-ID out of female genital mutilation ... Your access to abortion and getting pregnant – that happens because you are a woman . Stonewall has confused legal and biological questions with social identity and when you do that , you start to make bad law . ”
Media just harps on this every time saying conservatives are anti-choice and anti-women . Do they never get tired of the lies . There is no way abortion would be abolished . Most conservatives are fiscal conservatives who want to manage economy better not social conservatives .
Never . I'm Saved by the Blood of Jesus Christ . Pro-life Pro - guns . Pro-bringing God back into our Schools . And for the last time there are ONLY 2 GENDERS Male & Female . Get out of Crazy Town and wake up . This world is coming to and end Soon for Gods People .

I ’ m working on a story this week on the Belleville Knights of Columbus anti-abortion monument that was just erected in St . James Cemetery . What do you think about the monument ? qnetnews belleville
@Judcarp @LilaGraceRose Do you seriously think it would escape notice if women post-abortion ended up in the ER en masse ?
If you ’ re prolife , please unfollow me . Actually no , if you ’ re anything other than pro choice , unfollow me . Not only do we need to slow our growth in population , but we need to get this orphanage situation in hand . In all technicality , it ’ s a parasite until it ’ s no longer attached

@LegendaryEnergy @mattreyu05 How to be a Conservative Republican : WHINE and COMPLAIN . Believes others are getting FREE STUFF , Intolerant but claims To be CHRISTIANS , Pro-guns & pro-life ( impossible , based on Murders in U . S . ) . anti-Immigrants , Constitutionally illiterate & much more !
It's so sad it's so sad that Trump gets out there and check out stew these head knotters that Democrats are late-term abortion and open border freaks I mean come on that is bad
The value of life should never be in question .
@trooney184 @brent_peabody Nah . Like most things , making abortions illegal and defunding Planned Parenthood makes abortions more common . This is good news all around , especially for fetuses and newborns .
The problem with the pro-life movement is it's not willing to pay a cost . Freedom is costly . Are you willing to sacrifice ? Are you willing to stand in between the victims and the powers that be for this cause ? If you could see the victims every day would it change your approach ?
In a country that romanticizes and exaggerates the value and ideal of family , isn't it pretty ironic that motherhood is used to belittle leni robredo ? In a country that - criminalizes abortion and pro-choice - defends rape pregnancies - celebrates > 5 children families
@0fcourseyoucan lol you being outrage ? lol what a hopeless person I am still on pro-life because its better having a child & raise them well than having all people being homo you dont agree ? face your own problem , I dont have to get involved right
Dear @MoHCCZim why are you still criminalizing abortion ? It is time you acknowledge that policing women ’ s reproductive is wrong . We cannot keep lamenting deaths of young girls from unsafe abortions when you could ’ ve helped to protect them .
@nandaaalol Why are y ’ all so fixated on what others do with THEIR body lmao . An abortion ain ’ t affecting nobody but the mother .

@Squirrel_City_ @Woofaraw @politimac720 @CChiffley @LeahNTorres No , elective abortion is outlawed after viability ( about 24 weeks gestation ) . That means we * already * grant a viable fetus more rights than its host for approximately sixteen weeks .
@manmah28 @samaitadubs the ONLY true solution to this , as contraceptives don ’ t work 100 % of the time even if you are using them , is legal and safe abortion .

Safety of mother , only legal indication for abortion – Medical Practitioner - Realnews Magazine -
@wheresyasmin Feminism is about equality and fighting for equal rights for all . Since abortion places lives of tiny humans as of less worth than others and denies them of their equal right to life , it is NOT FEMINISM .
@JudicialWatch what I see funny also Ole George Soros just gave planned parenthood huge amount PAC $ $ , , so you Virginians can hopefully see how your under control of Soros ...

@peytnhaag A large amount of those who are prolife adopt . Luckily all newborns do get adopted according to statistics . With that being said , you would never allow a newborn to be killed just because the mother doesn ’ t want them . Because death isn ’ t a solution . I refuse to ignore any abuse .
Killing unwanted newborns is a problem ... but free abortion isnt lmaooo . Yall are clowns . Abortions are allowed ... at the lowest maximum of 13 weeks . And many places , as late as 24 weeks . Yall are MENTALLY UNSTABLE . Google what a baby looks like at these weeks in pregnancy .
At today's U . N . General Assembly , HHS Secretary Alex Azar advocated for U . N . member countries to ignore reproductive rights and women's health : " We do not support references to ... sexual and reproductive health and rights in U . N . documents . "
@NanaKimmieB @RepCohen where I come from we use turds like you for fertilizer . Now you may be an atheist or a Roaming Catholic but I am pretty sure you support abortion , therefore you are an accomplice to over 50 million baby deaths . Got it ? God has a special HOT HOT place for you in Hell .

@Motorhead0121 @Education4Libs I agree / disagree . Not all educators are like that . But it is not rare . There are many examples of leftist ideology being pushed in schools . How do you account for what kids believe these days ? Look at all the school demonstrations ? They ’ re not against abortion / pro gun , right ?

@ewarren Agreed . No one can be “ pro-life ” and also “ pro-death penalty ” . Murder is wrong , period .

If you believe " 2 + 2 = 31 " long enough , God is loving enough that He will allow you to . That's the reason why people are passionate about believing things like : • Abortion is ' healthcare ' . • There are more than 2 genders . • You can do enough good to get to heaven .

Abortion is not a right it ’ s a responsibility .
When religion has been used to dictate patient care : 🚨 Hospitals have refused to treat or refer someone who needs an abortion 🚨 Women suffering miscarriages have been denied the care they need 🚨 Health care providers refused care to transgender individuals ➡ ️ Put Patients First
Likewise , there are reasonable arguments to be made for the regulation of abortion . Not the criminalization , but the regulation . Just like we regulate other medical procedures , and other processes involving human bodies , like medical and other research .

@jeromepelaez If a woman's pregnancy is posed to have complications that can either harm the mother or the baby , then abortion should be an option . Women should be given the choice for their own bodies .
@nytimes Thank you Pro-Life Republicans ! ! !
@PPFA Abortion is a violent and barbaric act . It has no :p lace in a civilized society . Planned Parenthood does not care about women , they only care about money . Killing your child is never the answer .
@ash_5soslover94 @ghostcherries_ @KidCHAOSSS @AntiGravPlays @AuruLupus @Leafisall @softestlildoggo @KTfron pro-choice or pro-life a man shouldn't have an " opinion " on what a woman does with her body . women don't get an opinion on male birth control and they don't make the rules about it either but yeah we're sexist or whatever

@animadiscordia @C_Stroop Lol ... I've had them explain to me that my family's experiences escaping / surviving genocide aren't as important as their antichoice interpretation of those events . I wish that was a joke .
Abortion is in no way self-defense . You and whoever you had sex with are entirely responsible for the baby you made and now you have a responsibility to uphold its rights and keep it alive . In fact if the baby could fight back , THAT would be self-defense . But it can't , you coward

@ScottJohnsonMT @LiberalLogic9 @JamesDoss50 @getbusy5 @IkyCat @HoarseWisperer @BBCWorld Furthermore , line 88 states that consuming something or really doing anything that * knowingly * terminates the pregnancy is considered an abortion . How do you determine if a woman knew working a 12 hour shift would kill her baby ?
the whole pro-life argument is so tired
@maryycruz_ i had an old friend who went into foster care . she got raped . she couldn't get an abortion because of her abusive caretakers and her baby went into foster care themselves to continue the cycle . if you think that's okay then you have a problem .

@kgold661 @BroomBroon TY ❣ ️ Heard it from someone else , I just summarized . Adoption comes after birth . Its birth vs abortion and adoption vs family preservation . Wether or not I was adopted would not make a difference in the fact that I wasn ’ t aborted . Had we not been adopted we ’ d still have been born .
@shinslavia Abortion
@ABC An Act of Pro-Choice ? that's normal right , for the Left ?
@charliekirk11 Regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice , I know several women - pro-choice women - that were devastated by their miscarriage or , as she calls it , " mess on a napkin . " Ridiculous , insensitive argument .
Today > Monday 11Novembre 2019 . ABORTION = GRAVE SIN Before GOD . GOD Doesn't Care That Feminists's Men (= Rapists ) Don't Considere GOD's Scriptures . Their Support Is Useless For Ur Feminists's Soul Before GOD ! 👼 : Scriptures Didn't Change BCZ U Raped Her ! 😂
@kendal_renee_ @EvanAKilgore @ohmercy_me @annacantillo240 @MAGA_Jenn You're right about that , in more ways that you know . Abortion isn't something to celebrate . God gave you the gift of giving life and the fact that you see it is a burden instead of a gift is absolutely sickening . Your " pleasure " is what is most important to you . Incredible .
@HawleyGrant @Sam_DeLoach That ’ s funny , because most of the people I know who are anti abortion are anti abortion because they are ignorant of the havoc restrictive abortion laws wreak upon women , their lives and families .
Listen to providers : abortion is healthcare , and people have all sorts of reasons for seeking abortions .
@Sam_DeLoach @byrdbaylee Pro-life is normal . Pro-abortion is abnormal .
@_bitca_ @Poli_Sci_Head @scrowder Which is a legit issue with Pro-life in the USA . In most other countries Pro-life also means pro-assistance for young mothers ( I was one and found tons of help through charities ) , pro-universal health care , special gov ’ t grants for single parents attending Uni , etc .

Your Veterans Day reminder : Service members can't get abortions on-base , and even if they could , their insurance only covers abortion in the case of rape , incest , or if the pregnant person's life is in danger . Want to support service members ? Donate to an abortion fund .
@bradtsnyder @JLSalsbur @thehill I think we ’ re all overthinking it . They want power & influence . They may be compromised , but not necessarily .

Abortion care is health care — and your health care provider shouldn ’ t shame or be able to deny you care because of their personal beliefs . That ’ s why we ’ re fighting back with the Put Patients First act – a bill that would scrap Trump ’ s harmful rule for good .

@citizenhelene Strange . Maybe there's a whole pro-choice disco movement in france which we don't know about , thankfully
The only exception would be my child wanting to go to a Ghanaian school . With that , we'd have to find a way to deal with whatever disparities they encounter , because pro-choice if their reasons are genuine . Aside that , the obvious choice is what's above , no ?
I am sure there are many men who are against the decision made . But I am absolutely sure there are many , many men who not only encourage it , but some who demand it . This is on everyone .

@Pro_life_ANCAP @Matt5News @MarieStopes She is talking about not initially being able to be cared for by her family and friends following her abortion because of the stigma preventing her from talking to them .

I think abortion should be legal , but I don't think anyone should be forced to perform one .
My nephew and his wife had a stillborn at nine months . It was devastating . To insinuate they " had an abortion " is so beyond evil I can't even ...
Pro choice people are the definition of hypocrisy . The mothers of these pro-choice people gave them life . They were nurtured in the womb by there loving moms . Now they advocate for there mothers right to kill in the womb .

@TravisIsNeato @Everyone That's the " point " of conservatism , but in the abortion debate , the pro life position is the big government position .

@Sequoia_Red That's not for you to decide , not for the government to override doctors judgement of medical indication because a vocal minority feel abortion is wrong .
@tagruber @Prolife_IAM @POTUS If back Patriots
@eldepelolargomh If you cant fathom why there can be NO valid reason to commit murder then you have a huge problem . Abortion is murder . Murder is always , under all circimstances wrong . Period . History will remember your worldview as it remembers Hitler's Nazism .
This is ... just not true . At all . I had an abortion at 20 , of course it was a hard decision to make but i made it . I ’ m now almost 8 months pregnant and can 100 % confirm I made the right choice then .
Started reading a book that was supposedly “ revolutionary ” in terms of Christian spirituality and perfect for people who have been hurt and betrayed by the church ... this dude is anti-choice , thinks sexuality is a choice , and slut-shames women ... NEXT ❌
@Bryan4USA @KarenLeeCoyle20 @ABC First , I'm a Christian period ! Second we're not half prolife , if you're talking about the death penalty , thats biblical . I don't worship Trump , I worship God , so get that straight right now . Trump is flawed just like every other human being who ever lived except Jesus .
Do y ’ all not realize that the governor literally has no control over things like abortion & gun control ... that ’ s decided at the federal , NOT state level ! ! !

Check out his feed for his views on women's rights to choose and then read him later screaming that women are being omitted from the debate circuit because they are women ? Well yello , Do women have rights ONLY when you u say so ? R some women more equal than others ?
@teri_atthepaper @KYDemGrassroots Bevin loves abortion . If it was ever completely banned what the hell would he have to campaign on ? ? ? ! ! This is how he won the GOP primary against Comer . Honestly , Bevin should thank abortion for his political career .
@musicnewsfact As if being pro-choice means everyone has to get abortions . No one serious thinks that . He ’ s so ridiculously dumb LMAOO
@SanchezRMyla He won ’ t have to do it alone because we ’ re actually happily married ... We ’ re more than ready for parenthood that ’ s why we planned to have a child together so don ’ t worry about us 😊

If a pregnant women has the misfortune of losing an unborn child due to a vehicle accident involving alcohol , the drunk driver will likely be charged with the death of that unborn human Child ! An unborn human infant is a Baby ! !
As these teens grow and change , so does their bodies , so does their hormones . That is why it is important for them to have knowledge on reproductive health , sexual education and their rights . If they have the knowledge , they would be aware and if they have awareness ..

@byrdbaylee Yah . Not the best way to get all the facts . Too much info missing . I used to be essentially personally pro-life . I changed once I became pregnant and saw my baby trying to suck her thumb at 10wks b4 I could feel her moving .
That really is the essence of it
@ZubyMusic For liberals sex trumps everything ie - transgenders ( men ) in women ’ s sports even though they claim to fight for women . With abortion , their “ freedom ” to have sex and then the abortion is more important than the baby .
@buffsblg @LRT1x @LeahNTorres @MattWalshBlog I have no tendency to violence . You ’ re the only one talking about shooting people . Even still , what would I do to stop it ? Try to change peoples minds ? Vote for people who are pro-life ? Oh wait ...

@johninmpls @LeahNTorres She asked if I think somebody who's had a normal uncomplicated pregnancy would want an 8 month abortion based on the stories I've heard in this world the answer is yes might be a very small percentage of a percentage thank you for your intelligence I work on being smarter

@mukwidigwi @afrimomzim1 @boldcolours Every life is equally sacred . Hence we can find ways of preserving both lives . Unwanted pregnancy is not a death sentence . And that can not be a basis to take away human life . Abortion is just not an option here . Once a life is created , it ceases to just be about the mother .

Yes , but the difference is that abortion affects another human life and takes away a baby ’ s rights . Issues like gay rights / marriage don ’ t affect anyone besides those who personally wish to live lifestyle . Most conservatives supporting limited government would agree with Kirk here

@kathykattenburg @LibSelfOwns @NRO @xan_desanctis I get your point . However when some lawmakers changed abortion laws it is completely within the realm of possibilities that some doctors don't see that as healthcare . Not what they signed up for 20 years ago . An Ob / Gyn has plenty of other healthcare needs to fulfill .

@Leo97894180 @HobbsProlife She also implies that we support abortion as a solution to the rape ... Um , no . It ’ s a solution to the unwanted pregnancy that was caused by a rapist . It has to be willful ignorance to not see the relationship between rape and banning abortion .
Just because abortion is not an option for your situation does not mean it isn't for someone else . No one and I mean no one knows what others are going through and or has been through to make that difficult decision
@ProphetWalrus Yes , I know , it says that the lives of the marginalized are equally sacred to those of the unborn . It does not say that abortion is a social crime equal to others . It is perfectly legitimate to hold that abortion is worthy of special attention , without ignoring other crimes .

@DrSteveJacobs @dylrschn @LeahNTorres Got pregnant . Didn't want to be . Definitely knew I was carrying a human . Also knew I didn't want spend nine months carrying a child I didn't want . Decided terminating the pregnancy was the right decision for me . Had an abortion . That was 20 years ago . No regrets .
@Citizen004 @rebeccakschulz One concern would be harassment of physicians and others on the list . We already have that problem with identified abortion providers . Second would be access - would you need to be referred ? If so this bill allows doctors to decide not to refer you based on their beliefs .
If you have a chance today , organize a lecture about reproductive rights , or another issue you care about . ✊ 🏿

@BihlmanRiley @BeeAmellia @baimcpher Oh , I didn't realize your only concerns were with rape victims . You're against the other 98 % , then - right ? Because you wouldn't , in good conscious , try to justify abortion because of the less than 2 % of cases right ? That would be extremely disingenuous . Agreed ?

@BlueAlvey405 @RepKendraHorn @kfor @laceylett You must really love to pay taxes , supporting illegal immigrants , big self serving government , abortion up to time of birth , socialism and self serving politicians ! This country was going to hell in a hand basket carried by leftwing Democrats before President Trump got in office .
@cobalt5050 Abortion is an exception to that law .
@ewarren Liz is a racist murderer of infants . Abortion is killing black , brown and some white babies . Started by a female KKK , supported by dem policies of racial genocide . Congress should completely defund PP .
@SpinningHugo @MAM12CP As am I . I think this is an existential election that will set the UKs course for years to come . It's a binary choice that can't be ducked . If you do not vote for the best placed anti Tory candidate in a constituency you can credibly win , you're effectively voting Tory .
@CNN he is ProChoice . not ProAbortion . Funny how Trump was just in SC too . WTG churches !

Also ... does Boruto autocorrect to abortion for anyone else ? ? ?
@Classical_Dee @froggybsb03 @27Bridget @RBraceySherman A drs refusal to do an abortion isn't a violation of autonomy and neither are laws prohibiting abortion . Violations of autonomy occur when an action is being forced upon you ( blood donation ) . We are limited in the exercise of our autonomy 24/7 / 365 . Are you familiar w / laws ?

Abortion is about allowing women the right to make choices about when they want to have children in relation to their age , financial stability , relationship stability etc . It is not the place for Government to legislate against women's choices

@BillyHallowell True . We have one party openly hostile to the pro-life issue and the other which continues to fund Planned Parenthood in every spending / budget bill that is passed and signed .
Maybe I'll move to Ohio

Remember : When debating a Pro-Abortion advocate , their only tool is to use your own standards of truth against you . They don't actually believe in objective truth , so every objective premise they use is just a ploy . They're simply trying to confuse you to get their way .
@BellonaRevived Ha ! First of all , you're EXTREMELY wrong . I don't think you could be any more wrong . Second of all , I think we should stop abortion before we put immigrant children in the womb at risk for abortion . Third of all , there have actually been pro life organizations that donated

Aside from the doubtful numbers given for deaths from illegal abortions , my problem with this what it omits . I ’ m so tired of the fact that this debate rests on an idea that the right to sex is more important than the right to live , a premise that is never itself argued for .
The proposal would criminalize abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy , before many women realize they are pregnant .

🇨 🇦 is at the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 because we ’ re committed to ensuring that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health rights are not a privilege for the few .
But also because it frames the abortion debate as something which affects PEOPLE as a whole . The idea that we might deny people the right to control their bodies freaks most folks out . The idea that we might deny women that right , sadly , doesn ’ t have the same impact .

@taymomo5 @dotdotcarissa @p0ppysead @baimcpher It makes no sense to think that way . My mom had me when she was 15 . If she had gotten an abortion there are other kids who would be alive today instead of me because her life would have gone much differently . Did she deny them life by having me ?
It ’ s hilarious to me how many women say things like “ I would NEVER , not in one billion years , even if I was raped at gunpoint , get an abortion , I just think other people should be able to choose to ” I ’ m not even saying abortion should be outlawed bc it ’ s a super complex issue BUT

Heaven has gates and not everyone gets in . Jesus would also be against abortion and told people to keep their own money . Jesus is the farthest thing from people like Bernie
I am a devout pro-life Catholic and this sickens me . How do we expect someone to turn from sin when we deny them the unity with Christ that could actually change them from the inside out ? Yes , abortion is unthinkable , but Jesus taught us to love the sinner and hate the sin .

In the @AmerMedicalAssn ’ s Journal of Ethics , Anita Silvers , Leslie Francis , and Brittany Badesch make a case for the reproductive and parenting rights of Disabled Women :
@cmclymer @Kate_Kelly_Esq I ’ m reminded that Ruth Bader Ginsberg , as a young lawyer working on abortion rights , was upset that Row established the legality of abortion based on privacy rather than the equality of women . I hope she will see that equality enshrined in the Constitution very soon .
@NewYorkStateAG Do you really have a J . D . ( law degree ) ? ? Where in the Constitution does it mention reproductive ” rights ? ” I must have missed it . The 14th Amendment does however state , ” ... nor shall any State deprive any person of LIFE , liberty , or property , without due process of law ... ”
Of course , complications may arise , but they can be well prevented when the process is done by a qualified person , not quacks . And we are not saying abortion by drinking seven up and salt of whatever it is we hear commonly . Our customs wont just allow the thing to be legalised .

@DSiPaint @AndersEigen @PPFA @ecerv2004 The only way to solve your issue is to tackle the problems of sex trafficking and abuse , not abortion . Banning abortion won ’ t change any of that
Franklin Graham calls on pastors and priests to deny pro-choice politicians communion like one just did to Joe Biden -
Amen .. Thank you Jesus ! ! !
@LifeSite Abortion Rights ! Pro-life-arguments = worthless Heartbeat not criteria ! indicates little more than cells and electrical activity Unsafe Abortion : Maternal Mortality
The reproductive rights movement makes history in Oaxaca , Mexico
@ChristianPost The vast majority of abortions occur early in the first trimester , even those that occur in the 2nd , are performed well before any kind of nervous system develops . It's literally impossible in almost any instance for there to be pain . Stop the emotional hyperbole prochoice
@GarrettKarney Ur literally voting against people ’ s freedoms by being pro-life ... make it make sense ... no one is asking u to abort the baby , all we want is the freedom to choose ... a concept
Please don't make me have a baby , please don't make me give birth , please don't force it and call it prolife . My right to be childfree , my reasoning and my choice matter a billion times more than your prolife stupid violation of my freedom . Women across the world should have this
Great .
@inLaurasWords I actually was able to get regular healthcare covered by Planned Parenthood and the CVS MinuteClinic but I always go down these " what ifs " of , like , if I got the nicer healthcare would I go to therapy or a dermatologist again ? would that be worth an extra $ 1,200 / month ?
@nowantfakenews @ildfluer @ABC Yeah whatever there's the law then there's reality and planned parenthood corruption where they give our money to corrupt ppl running for office who approve abortion . Democrat party is a criminal mafia

@Brooke_Kelly87 @squattchie How can pro choice people hate us for fighting to stop the murders of these defenseless “ human beings 🤭 @Alyssa_Milano do you still feel good about your abortions after seeing this dead mutilated baby who shares the same fate as your babies ? Humanity Lost Its Way Insanity
@CatholicAwesome The problem here is not “ supporting ” late term abortion - which I do when necessary - it ’ s that anti-choice propaganda says people get to 8 or 9 months and go have an abortion just because they feel like it . That ’ s bullshit , and that lie needs to stop .
@LeahNTorres Pro life is anti science , they would rather protect a nonsentient clump of cells no more alive than a sperm than women because they dont think women are people . Not only that , but globally , without fail , their policies cause more abortion and more maternal mortality .

You know other than the classic just walk away .
@KamalaHarris Wow now that ’ s crazy , so when it comes to women ’ s rights , reproductive health rights is off the table , so tell me this why would you damage a young girl that she has to have a baby that ’ s a result of rape .
@realDonaldTrump Jeer Deezus ! ! It ’ s Monday , Captain Abortion Gone Wrong ... it ’ s too early for you to be whining this much ! !
Most of the people supporting the anti bully group is lot more logical in their other tweets too . Pro bully is full of filthy language & trolls.That ' s a general observation . Having a choice is ok.Forcing a choice is not . It is quality vs quantity this time . Bigg Boss13 bb13
I missed it , who screen recorded it ? I ’ ll give u 10 % on ya next abortion visit ! !
@beachlifeRN @BethMooreLPM @Alyssa_Milano Do you think President Trump really cares about abortion ?
@MelissaWhyppe @tariwemadimples Do not be anxious of what you shall eat wear consider birds of the sky or lillies of the earth they neither toil or spin yet they survive children are a blessing from God no justification or whatever for abortion
- it is wrong to imply that access to medical services ( especially abortion and MAID ) is not an issue in this day and age . it is - including in Alberta . we need FEWER barriers , not more .
Even as a GOP white male evangelical for years , I wasn't an asshole ( I don't think ) . I occasionally voted Dem , was always pro-choice even being anti-abortion . Was always pro-lgbt rights . It's hard for me to understand the level of asshole my former party has gone to this decade .
Oh , yes . I ’ ll still give donations to individual candidates . Also , when the Republicans funded Planned Parenthood in their budget , I sent my former donation times 10 to a pro-life crisis pregnancy ministry that helps women & babies rather than to the RNC .
@ScottishTBB79 @LiveAction I wouldn ’ t really consider that an abortion . Typically before you even find out you are pregnant you ’ ll miscarry or your tube will rupture .
A Bevin poller just ring my bell and asked me two questions about pro-choice candidates and if I could vote for them . Um ... yep . byebevin
@becgop @funnythin @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump He also cheated on his pregnant wife with a prostitute . I'm sure he would have paid for her abortion . Wake up .
Republicans say they are pro life , but only for the fetus . Life encompasses so much more than conception . What happens after birth is more important . Healthcare , education , clean air and water are very important , too .
@Not_OvaryActing @animadiscordia @HobbsProlife How the hell is Heather comparing rape to abortion when ~ one of the two ~ is consensual . Having an abortion was NOT like being raped all over again , imo .
@MyFaithVotes People including priests don't want to preach Hell , Fire , & Brimstone anymore . But they kind of need to sometimes . People need to realize just how seriously wrong abortion is . And how seriously important it is to obey the 10 commandments .

I think my favorite thing is when self claimed “ prolifers ” comment and stalk every single one of my posts thinking they ’ re “ correct ” in any form . The fact that they don ’ t follow me and go out or their way to comment on all of my new posts immediately is just sad , prochoice
@michaelmalice It ’ s akin to thinking left wing politicians want tax payer funded abortion on demand solely because of planned parenthood .
アラバマ州頭おかしいんじゃないか 。
lol I see the Internet didn ’ t change without me . Gay married , pro-choice , pro weed legalization , for reforming prisons , for public education and anti-war is now conservative . Conservative is the New Liberal , coming to Netflix soon ! ( Also I think I was 12 in this pic . )
my dad and I differ in some of our social / political views but he is pro choice and doesn ’ t care too much about me dancing which is pretty good for a boomer honestly

@maxfawcett @tim4hire @Citizen004 @danicamclellan @DonBraid It is not a same day service arrangements can be made to go to a bigger town if necessary . Why is it we fight for pro choice but then try to take the choice away from doctors . In emergency I agree and feel then there should be compelling law to make doctors comply in emergency

I'm " anti-inequality on abortion too " . I . e . if a woman has a choice of parenthood after pregnancy ( several of them in fact ) the man should have it too .
@baimcpher This tweet is dumb and holds no real logic , you don ’ t have a chance to get that attached before an abortion , if you knew anything about pregnancy then you would know the “ ultrasounds ” and “ kicks ” don ’ t happen until waaay into your pregnancy .

muslims are actually fine with transgender people and only some sects criminalise homosexuality , plus we're also okay with abortion , please don't compare us to christian evangelicals 🙃

@CindyKendrick11 Is it too late for abortion ?
Next time a “ friend tells you they are a Christian & a Democrat ask them this : Which political party supports sacrificing babies to Satan ? Women please don ’ t believe the PC crap that abortion is a healthcare ...
Created Equal believes Black Lives Matter . That ’ s because they understand black mothers are targeted by planned parenthood and “ abortion services ” the most . Black babies are killed far more than any other race to abortion . It ’ s very sad !
SC ’ s heartbeat abortion ban heads to Senate floor , now with exceptions for rape , incest This is still a horrible piece of legislation .
