@PaulaSwan10 @LeahNTorres I'm not actually interested in indulging your argument about why you should get to impose your will on other people .

@SusanOkafor6 @Elizabe81800061 @patrickmadrid The " pro-choice " Catholics must be a neomarxist invention . They are not real Catholics .

Catholics celebrating Joe Biden denied communion for his pro-choice stance should understand the difference between ‚Äú promoting abortion ‚Äù and believing criminalizing abortion would have even greater consequences . That might be wrong but it ‚Äô s far from promotion .

@_MattHarris_ @TheantiantiZio1 @ThrwLkngGlss @DemMaj4Israel i know that . but to their followers , they represent observant judaism . and neither does or says anything to sway their followers from believing it . case in point when ben got involved in arguing abortion . he did a google search and gave it as " what religious leaders believe "
@Sequoia_Red @OwlFoxVT @bnuckols @liberty_deity @LeahNTorres For some women having √§n abortion IS taking responsibilty . You just feel its selfish , but your feelings are not something you get to impose onto society . Body integrity is , in fact , a human right . Facts dont care about your feelings . It is her body her choice .
Abortion is murder
No . Judicial bypass is already really burdensome , and can be discriminatory towards young people . Clerk of Courts are ill-informed on it , and it can delay care for young people . Ask FL Leg Fl Repro Freedom

@aurelianeb @ZubyMusic . Then learn to use CONTRACEPTION ! ! SIMPLE FACT FOLKS . Abortion is not and never should have been a means of birth control . Grow the F up already .
Remember Scheer is a liar . OPINION | Andrew Scheer is effectively pro-choice , why not just own it ? : Opinion | CBC News
@Joe_Glidden @DLoesch Her body , her choice . Isn ‚Äô t that how you liberals justify abortion ?
@BeaugJohnson see and the opinions where we disagree are still there . i still think that there should be access to abortion , i still believe there should be gender neutral bathrooms and that trans people deserve rights and all of those beliefs i am still true too . those just don't define ...
ACLU said reproductive rights üëè üèª
@MikhilaMcDaid @MizzWorthy I think you can choose not to want to do something the same way ( that is your right ) but to make a moral judgement ( OP : " not good " ) defeats the point of being pro choice . What you're saying is " you're allowed to choose but I'm going to think you're shitty for it " ; makes no sense
@allisonandpons @sdequus Because abortion is the killing of an innocent human being . A fetus is scientifically not a clump of cells . And , nobody has the right to kill innocent humans . The right to life is the  1 right we have .
@leftist_dirtbag @Doctor13511 @AP Religion is not dictating law . Abortion is murder . Facts do matter . The government cannot force an individual to act against their own concscious . There ‚Äô s plenty of pukes out there that will still perform your abortion or ‚Äú other ‚Äù needs .
@KyleLykins102 @MadamS8N @CrazyChrisAB @fight4women @Stacy_g52 @XplosiveTweets @DrowningBlonde @InjuredAlex @Sam_DeLoach @LeahNTorres don't know about you depraved " pro-life " folk but I certainly care that our idiotic administration is cruelly locking up people who are just trying to seek asylum in our country , and separating them from their children
@ThisisROXX @1followernodad Yet he ‚Äô s not treating his sons in the same manner . I ‚Äô m glad planned parenthood read him .
Now the end Begins Evil of Abortion What if It were you as the Baby What If your mom did this to you if your ProChoice Repent or perish

@DnlPgh60 @mpj214 @LilaGraceRose I am not obfuscating . I am ( or was ) trying to have a discussion regarding the topic at hand . You want to change the subject to what I believe about when person hood occurs . Totally different subject . YOU interjected the implanted zygote vs abortion issue , not me .

@Daemon29135127 @LucienGreaves @jasonrapert Also ? Thanks to theocratic nonsense , Planned Parenthood has been muscled out of my part of Arkansas .

@catoyescaesarno @rhodymatt13 @polite_netizen @Aella_Girl You completely misunderstand , I AGREE with you , that abortion should be considered murder . The difference is how we defend that stance . I prefer to use logic , reason , and evidence . You appear to prefer making emotional appeals . I consider my approach more convincing .
@collinsgru yes , over abortion

@rockdoc666 @GlobalEdmonton @RachelNotley @jkenney ... definitively predicted ? This is where proper health care ( something Kenney doesn't know about ) is so important so precautions / monitoring / care etc can deal with the risks which may present . I am one hundred 100 % against abortion but as it is misused and used for no reason ...
@bazzavengers2 @shelneykheannah I ‚Äô m not saying your wrong . But i do have . Question about that though . Should the guy have to pay child support since he asked for the abortion but she chose to keep it ?

@sbmedia78 centre-ing the abortion discussion on definitions misses crucial information , the perspective of the pregnant person . listen to pro choice advocates like myself who are mothers . our stance is based in an understanding of what childbearing involves .
@Truth_Thumper @Jayne1115 @lmsespeaks @Legally_De @EquityForward Everyone knows that eliminating abortion is not the pro-life goal ... it's goal is UTERUS CONTROL . It is not about what is in the INCUBATOR'S best interest just the fetus's . Using shame , intimidation & misinformation its the only play the forced birthers have to keep control

@coffeemama91 I'll believe you're actually " pro-life " when you hold Donald Trump accountable for the multiple abortions he's paid for and all the kids he's letting rot at the border . Oh right you don't actually care about babies . My bad . Typical fraud you are .
@tperkins @realDonaldTrump They do it to every president with pro-life , pro-family policies . Who can forget the Reagan , Bush 41 , and Bush 43 impeachments ? So you're right , Derpkins , it has nothing to do with Trump ‚Äô s corruption and contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law .
I wonder how funny she'll think killing babies is when the fires of Gehenna are being stoked for her ?

@cherrycola_life @PPFA @parentsmagazine That might be why some people insist on it . But many don ‚Äô t think late abortion should be limited only to these cases . Do you think it should be limited only to these circumstances ?

@flashgo21 @AggressionMacro @EvilCEOE @AnitaM86 @MattWalshBlog Both are wrong . The contraceptive mindset - that sex is recreational and procreation is an accident of it rather than its aim and reason for being makes abortion inevitable and is often cited for why it is needed .
Following Jesus and praying for those who believe abortion of a baby is fine is hardly cultic .
@Liz_Wheeler @KamalaHarris Murder . All we hear about is a " woman's reproductive rights " , but unborn loggerhead turtles , bald eagles , and baby seals have more protections . More black babies are aborted than born . You would think Kamala Harris would consider that .

If you voted for Trump for some moral principle - say , abortion - but you oppose all of this other obviously wicked and sinful behavior , then SAY SOMETHING . DO SOMETHING . They will continue to get away with all of this as a direct consequence of your silence .
It never ceases to amaze me that white women can write articles about abortion that completely lack nuance in large publications , yet we don ‚Äô t give space to people of color to describe the realities of their lives and experiences with abortion .

100 % pro choice without apologies or exceptions . You decide for yourself , I decide for myself . Religion Politics Medicine Good or bad Smart or stupid Selfish or selfless 100 % your call for you . 100 % my call for me . In the land of the FREE Right ? Freedom 4 all or Freedom 4 none
Butthole Surfers - Human Cannonball The Butthole Surfers were one of my earliest favorite bands somewhere in middle school through high school . Locust Abortion Technician is their bad acid peak and this song is the catchiest thing on there by far without losing any fuckedness .
@detective26AD I believe that there are a lot of systemic problems that lead to women having to make the choice to abort or not . If you're committed to addressing those systemic problems with every fiber of your being , every dollar and every vote you've got--then be pro-life .
@DelegateFowler You keep making big over your opponent's opposition to abortion even when the pregnancy is a threat to the mother ... can you give me a name of a person that was pregnant in that situation or is it just a straw lady argument .
@KamalaHarris @HigherHeights Maybe they should be fighting abortion , absent fathers and black on black crime .
@weloveleave @paulrey99 @Jean52601194 @oflynnsocial Good gawd , we already have these checks ! 4th time But if you want to be pedantic , try Abortion , Gay marriage they are different but strangely enough not against the GFA .

we can talk about the emotional complexity of abortion . that is very necessary . and part of that emotional complexity is the fact that for some people it is empowering - or healing - or otherwise important to them to shout their abortion or crack jokes about it .
@nudavid09 @charliekirk11 I'm not in support of abortion , but it's just a necessary evil in some cases . Deformed child ? Mothers life at risk ? See , it's not as easy . A healthy baby should not be aborted , but the same energy should be used to raise the child to be a better human .
@Leo97894180 @OwlFoxVT @2scooops @Downeyangel @ahaacksucks @KrisRHoyt @LeahNTorres Not an abortion and they didn ‚Äô t kill twin A first and then remove her from twin B as elective abortion does so as to PREVENT a live birth .

@glennbeck Hollywood funds abortion , fights 2a and 1a free speech and religion , pushes socialism ... and Glenn funds them prolifically thru his movie addiction . What " principles " do you have , Glenn ? I do not think that word means what you think it means .
@Shelbywa839 70 % of the countries worldwide allow abortion only in specific cases . Majority disagree with you !
Will we ever know whether a particular fetus can already feel pain ? With birth control readily available , morning after pills there for rape & birth control failure , why put your bodies & mind through the awful abortion & the guilt & doubts about who your baby could have been ?

@ChristieLea @nixheathen @sentientdreamer @Stressied_Out @lloomer80 I mentioned how the founder of Planned Parenthood would be pleased with how many African Americans babies are being aborted .

For those asking , we are def not together , he decided to walk out a day after the abortion happened . I ‚Äô m not in the right state of mind nor am I emotionally ok , I still have pregnancy symptoms due to the abortion pills so I feel depressed , emotional , and lots of regret .
@D_Dee_Abrahams What makes you lot think abortion is only because the person thinks its a mistake ? A doctor will advice you to terminate a pregnancy if it poses a risk to you or your childs life . So maybe you should look at it from that perspective instead of the same one y ‚Äô all believe in .

@BaskingSnark @GlobalEdmonton @globalnews Abortion has been around , but was not as part of general practice . Doctors refer patients to a specialist they believe can help a with a particular condition . If a doctor does not believe abortion is the correct medical action to a situation they are not required to refer .
wow ahah this blew up , don't forget that abortion is not a crime and it should be normalised and that only women should make laws about their bodies and if you think otherwise you can go fuck yourself
@ddwiese @KFerrugia Are you sure you don't even feel your reproductive rights aren't being infringed upon ? ? ?

@SummerOf1972x Child molester or predator is a more accurate term in my opinion . Pedophile is a paraphillia and not a choice so we can't do much about that for now . A good thing to do is to spread the ideology that kids can't consent . Fortunately , that's the ideology of anti contact nomap .
@allanimalrights @herbivore_club I feel the same way a out planned parenthood .
@CoxeAnne @Exination1 @EquityForward So is that why my mother who aborted my sibling is depressed , and cries about her abortion every day ? It improves their lives , so why is she so miserable and ashamed ? If it was such a good thing , why do women naturally feel ashamed or reluctant to do it ?
@Pro_life_ANCAP @dylanmattress @candktoo @Godisgood1836 well I ‚Äô m no longer connected to my mother ‚Äô s umbilical cord .
Am looking at a report produced on status of abortion rights which has listed reasons for recriminalizing abortion linked to the CRPD Committee jurisprudence , and not even a fair assessment of it . And in fact , cites a newspaper article that references it . Ugh .
@stillgray The problem with that reasoning is that people on both sides of many arguments ( e . g . , abortion ) see each other that way . It is better to air both sides and allow the general audience to decide .

This is messed up . The restriction and control of women's bodies are literally putting our lives at risk . This is NOT okay . Whatever religion or institution you are , you have no right to take away a woman's choice . It's deeply sexist and dangerous .
Why shouldn't the man have an opinion ? A man was involved in the making of the baby that was aborted . Men should have a say before a women take it upon herself to abort a baby that it took two people to make . Maybe the man would like to have that baby ?
His argument is bad . Does he think babies born to a single mom should have to be put up for adoption and only allowed to be adopted by a 2 parent ( mom & dad ) home ? If this were the case , I don ‚Äô t think it would decrease the rate of abortion at ALL which is what he prob wants ? ?

Until a baby comes out of a mans body , an opinion on abortion shouldn ‚Äô t come out of his mouth .
Transphobic arguments about biological reality can so easily become heterosexist . People were using ' reproductive reality ' to argue against gay rights all the way up to the recent fights for equal marriage , and they'll certainly start again given the chance .

" Dont have sex with people you don't want to have a baby with " is often said by those who used other methods like Plan B or abortion ... or they're the perpetually single chicks who are bitter . Life doesn't work that way . People change . A lot of men are irresponsible .
I've come to the conclusion that abortion is prolife . Extinguish the flame before it can see the cruelty of the world , before it will be dampened by the horror of reality , before it is has awareness of its own demise .

@terry_d_lawson @ewarren Yes ! Same for me with the way she speaks about repealing the Hyde Amendment - unequivocally clear about how it impacts people disproportionately and who it harms . No back and forth . No pandering or trying to appease anti-choice .
@alexhern I mean it makes sense I guess , because access to abortion brings TFR in line with the actual number of live births . But hmm .

@LyleShelton Why is abortion wrong ? Let's also not look at it as murder because simply it's not murder . It's due to your beliefs you hold on to . That's all it is your forcing your views onto others .

@huimin_ey Abortion in Malaysia is legal since 1989 when a doctor deems it necessary for a women ‚Äô s mental / physical wellbeing . When a woman seeks abortion , she needs to consult a doctor & a doctor needs to make judgement that this is her decision for her wellbeing & not under duress

@Johnthemadmonk In reality , Cupich and the 68 others oppose the Author of Life . Mass abortion may be the greatest evil of all time and does not even come close to any " dignity " issues .

@LilaGraceRose @RepUllman Many women carry the burden of having miscarriages which is made worse by the abortion culture that insists that it's not a big deal . It is a big deal and women should feel free to grieve and seek support without being told or pressured to go on like nothing happened .

The National Women's Health Network ( @TheNWHN ) rightly explains early miscarriage and abortion together . Only recently have they been as conceptually separate as we now tend to see them .

It's hard to believe there are so many unwanted pregnancies . Clearly ! Abortion is not the answer that should be chosen , there are so many that can't conceive and would be more then happy to adopt them . Give babies a chance to life murder is wrong . üò• ‚ù§
Did you chat about how your sabotage of the Affordable Care Act , your never ending attempts to defund and destroy Planned Parenthood and your vote to give the wealthy a huge unpaid tax savings have impacted maternal health and childcare ?
@BLUEFIGS @nyet @NunesAlt @newtgingrich Yeah but deep down you all know the dnc is a DUMPSTER FIRE üî• Long overdue to obliterate the party of slavery , kkk , and abortion on demand ... RI Pdnc üòÅ üëå
@SenatorDurbin Fast-tracked ? How long ago was Sandy Hook ? Our babies deserve Leadership that ‚Äô s truly pro-life .

@rainmc Then you don ‚Äô t agree with the pro-choice libertarian position and you ‚Äô re more delusional than you were 10 minutes ago .
@JanetMorana Except for antibiotics-some give even when not necessary-this is true . Also you likely won ‚Äô t meet your abortionist until the day of your abortion and you won ‚Äô t be able to search him / her on google for recs because most clinics keep them anonymous ( for their safety not yours . ) üò°
@GNCordova An intact hymen doesn't equal virginity . Men need to learn about women's bodies , this is so unacceptable . Idiots like Tip are the reason we have so many anti-choice laws in the US .
Driving to work yesterday I saw a van that I though had " professional abortion " written on the side of it like an ad , which I thought was ... interesting . I looked again and it was a Tree Doctor service van and it said " professional arborist . "

@xenocryptsite but Yglesias ' point is what Dem candidates in red / purplish states actually do in practice , though - right ? Sinema , Manchin , etc . - they're all culturally conservative . Dem governors who win in red states , like Edwards in Louisiana , is pro-life , pro-gun , etc . Yglesias ' point is only
This thread is absolutely insane
@samth3ham Honestly it would be though ! And then imagine right after they announce the abortion they start bringing out bottles and blunts from the back room ! ! ! And everyone starts getting lit and celebrating

@caugustmcmullen Reproductive rights should be protected , and I wouldn't want pro lifers to use this to try to limit those .
@MarkDice The radicals will never be satisfied . Remember , abortion safe , legal + rare - now abortion on demand .

@raynabeth If you are in a pinch , Planned Parenthood has free birth control ( go to the office , say you don ‚Äô t have health insurance ) . I know it might be different than a current one you use but it ‚Äô s better than not having it !
@PatriciaHeaton For the bird , it ‚Äô s just instinct . It takes a human to see beauty in it . What ‚Äô s frightening is how many humans don ‚Äô t see the ugliness of abortion .
@LockedDoorway @hollychilek @LeahNTorres Abortion doesn ‚Äô t kill children . It ‚Äô s healthcare .
