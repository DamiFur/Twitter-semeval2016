Oh , bless your heart - we definitely aren ‚Äô t sisters . Abortion absolutely can be selfless , healing , compassionate , and an act of love . This is what happens when you center an actual person and their needs over a fetus . Again : if you don ‚Äô t like abortion , feel free to never have one .

The GREATEST MISOGYNY : the annual murder w / impunity by Pro Abortion women of 20,000 , 000 XX chromosome baby girls < 41 wks old . THAT'S MISOGYNY ! Prolife Aborts Abortion
It is unfair to call pro-choice ‚Äú anti-life . ‚Äù It is unfair to disregard a myriad of problems these children and mothers might face : no access to housing , income , healthcare , or education . It is unfair to say there aren ‚Äô t situations in which they will live and suffer . mchslang21
I feel so bad for him tbh . Imagine attacking women's reproductive rights , weaponising religious extremists and neonazis , putting countless immigrants and lgbtq + , destroying the planet and allowing countries to meddle in your political system . And then being disliked and booed ? !

@stinkydogagain @HedwigGraymalk @LiamDan36816827 @LeahNTorres Sex should never be illegal . Your obsession with sex is weird . Abortion should be illegal . No innocent human lives should be killed due to the convenience of the mother simply because she didn't want the outcome of her behavior .

@tariwemadimples Abortion should not be legalised .. it is just wrong , consenting adults should know the consequences of sex .. there is no excuse there only rape cases should be considered for abortion as well as any condition that puts the mum at risk of losung her life

the right to marriage and family is a human right . everybody should have the right to parenthood . everybody should have reproductive rights . adoption agencies denying to-be parents because they're disabled , poor , single , too old , lgbt + , any minority , infringes on human rights

I know this is random but since I see Thx Birth Control trending I should point out that you can be pro life and pro birth control . I respect those who have religious objections to it but I personally have little issue with birth control it reduces abortion and unwanted pregnancy

Till then , it's just about control .

@baimcpher There ‚Äô s a reason why a lot of anti-choice people get abortions themselves .
If anti-choice people really cared about babies they'd be doing everything possible to end domestic violence . According to the CDC , 20 % of pregnant women in the US experience physical violence from their partner . Doctors say the violence is often directed at the belly .
@ComradeJiggly @dante_verita @rhetanddisc Wow that's actually dumber than most pro-choice arguments . Most will say it's not killing " of a human " or something but will at least be smart enough to acknowledge that it's ending the life of a living being , even if it's dehumanized to " cell clump " or whatever . Congrats .
Sooo I guess everybody ‚Äô s in a pretty good mood over there at NRA Headquarters today ? Also , can you imagine the outcry if Planned Parenthood of the Teamsters tweeted something that targeted a citizen who ‚Äô s just trying not to get dead ? This is insane & its time to nix the NRA .
According to this prolife group , passing the equal rights amendment that would make women equal under the constitution , would be a ‚Äú step back ‚Äù . It ‚Äô s not solely about abortion and was creased back in the 1900s . I love when prolife admits to their women hating ways . prochoice

@beachlifeRN I don ‚Äô t dispute that its an agenda . The problem is that you can ‚Äô t stop them by exaggerating .

It would be so much nicer if Congress passed the Bill preventing infanticide of children who are born alive after abortion . Children are so much more important than animals . Congress should know this !

Welcome to a satanic world
@DylanByers to be fair , Bezos wants to move manufacturing off the planet in order to reduce carbon and toxic emissions . Also , Bill Gates spends billions on population control and abortion .
I just posted " If your pregnancy test is positive and you're not ready , contact our abortion clinic in Springs at + 2772779339 0 " on Reddit
@kneeclayspeaks @DaphGillentine @DrAshSaleh @SierraDeciduous Being pro-choice means you approve of the choice to kill helpless human beings . That's forcing death on someone , violating their right to life and right to bodily autonomy , and doing so when they are at their most vulnerable . That's not opinion , that's fact .
@Pro_life_ANCAP " So you want school choice , gun choice , religious exercise choice , taxation choice , health insurance choice , union choice ? " " lololol no just abortion , but don't call me pro-abortion you forced-birther "
Looks like Virginia may end up like CA since the Governor , the House , and the Senate will all be controlled by Democrats . On the road ahead : higher taxes , gun control , abortion on demand ( even after birth ) , $ 15 minimum wage , sanctuary cities , and removal of Confederate monuments .
@TallHappyDad @dccra As a pro-life person , aren't you able to factor in the 99.999 % of lives on Earth rather than just the lives that end with abortion in the US ?
Y'all really want kids to starve cause the parents are poor or crappy . Usually the same pro-life crew .
@bluesidesoul @dihelling @MichaelTowery @LilaGraceRose The choice for death is a very sad choice , indeed . When women who conceive in rape & then abort are interviewed 5-10+ years out , most have very deep regret for aborting . Friends had often pushed them into abortion at the time . It didn't make the rape " go away . " It cost them joy .

@timshawisamoron yeah , exactly . I hate articles like this and it's just plain and simple lazy journalism . how about this guy goes and covers something important , like maybe , gay marriage and abortion is now legal in Northern Ireland or that we're fighting climate change because we want a future
@theminorchords Dems must be for abortion rights .
@imajsaclaimant Yeah but theres some anti semitic trolls on social media and Labour haven't expelled them from the country so we have no choice but to prefer cruel Tory policies to a compassionate Government .
So many of my ‚Äú Christian ‚Äù , ‚Äú pro-life ‚Äù relatives are appalled when I say l am going to donate my remaining embryos when I ‚Äô m done having kids . Even when I say my other option is destroying them . How does this make sense ?
@baimcpher i was pregnant at 19 , wasn't ready for a baby , and had an abortion . it makes no difference . :)

@rodericksember @LibertyCliff Fact - the federal government is the largest employer in the US Fact - there have been on average a million babies killed annually through abortion since the 1970s - perspective Germany killed 6mil Jews in 5yrs during the holocaust
Je kunt hiervan zeggen wat je wil , maar deze man is tenminste eerlijk . Hier draait het om . De pro-choice beweging is geen beweging voor vrouwen , maar tegen het ongeboren leven . Ze geven er niet om , het heeft geen bestaansrecht . Bedankt Daan , voor deze eerlijke erkennen .
Tbt to that time I almost got kidnapped outside an abortion clinic
Which fake god do you pray to ? One who allows you to usurp divine authority to twist and shout scripture as a prop for your views ? Jeremiah 1:5 is nothing to do with abortion . Bible Abuse Fakechristianity
@chloeyloman @deniseharle @Essos_Westeros @Rachelhodder @Sam_DeLoach @Antihumanswhop1 @luckyhubbyguy But if a woman is ‚Äú pro-choice ‚Äù she is choosing for another person . Her baby . It ‚Äô s evil .
Since Roe v Wade , abortions have dropped and more people say they are ' pro-life ' .
@lizzwinstead @MotherJones Another thing that bothers me is that calling anti-choice people " anti-abortion " implies that anyone who defends the pro-choice position--legal & safe access to abortion - - " favors " abortion in some morally simplistic sense .

@Stilbongod @ChurchofSatan @SayWhenLA That's Satanism pushing abortion . It counts as a blood sacrifice .

@BraydenKaplan @swordspirit80 @PeteButtigieg Honestly , you don't have to like abortion to understand the argument re bodily autonomy - - and it's even a conservative one ( which a lot of libertarians back ) .
