OK Pastor ! That Priest cannot go against his dictates any more than you could marry a gay couple and expect not to get fired . Shame ! Biden should go to a different denomination if he has conflicting values .
@dalesamples @TheBabylonBee The only ones advocating baby murder are people who frame contraception and abortion as murder . Your own God is the biggest baby murderer if miscarriage is the termination of a pregnancy . I mean , his will and all , right ?
@glimmer017 @Nixanadoo @mordechai_jones @ReproRights " ABORTION IS BABY MURDER ! " is emotional manipulation . I've just stated the fact that abortion is the deliberate destruction of an innocent human being in the womb . But feel free to keep saying that stating facts is emotional manipulation

@AndyFoxWAVY @WAVY_News Do you think the governor ’ s statement on late-term abortion and sanctuary cities have motivated any Republicans ?
@Sam_DeLoach @LeahNTorres I mean , we could go into the bizarre politics of the completely unhinged antichoice movement from the split that occurred in Operation Rescue and led to more violent splinter groups that PHYSICALLY engage at clinics , or you could believe women . 🤷 🏽 ‍ ♀ ️

@ladyinmedicine @AlKhidrVibes Not really . If we fuddle the pro-life position with capital punishment then we're confusing the innocence of unborn children with the guilt of convicted criminals . Opponents of abortion do not need to oppose capital punishment , by any means .
@NRA @RealDeanCain It is not the guns or the clips or the bullets , any more than the people who do bad things . * could be crockpot bombs and steak knives ...

Oh , bless your heart - we definitely aren ’ t sisters . Abortion absolutely can be selfless , healing , compassionate , and an act of love . This is what happens when you center an actual person and their needs over a fetus . Again : if you don ’ t like abortion , feel free to never have one .

@Lothdashaus @HataHZappa @cjzero What legislation works “ to keep families together ” ? Helping other requires no legislation . Most Christian charity comes wrapped in with proselytization . Last I heard murder was illegal . Are you referring to abortion ?
No one should live in poverty . No Middle Ground Everyone should have housing . No Middle Ground Everyone should get an education . No Middle Ground Every women has the right to an abortion . No Middle Ground We will end endless wars . No Middle Ground
what ’ s funny tho is ppl judge women regardless of their choice . if you unexpectedly get pregnant and keep the baby ppl talk shit . but you ’ re also a piece of shit if you choose abortion . you can ’ t win with miserable ass ppl who have nothing else better to do than talk shit .

@RepKJackson A vote for ANY Democrat is a vote in support of this :
You know , the difference between pro life and pro choice is , pro choice suits everybody . It gives the women control over their body . If they want to keep the baby they can & if they don ’ t they don ’ t have too . So you have a personal choice . How can people be against that 😑

@ShariOdell @AP_Politics @AP Amazing . These people are sick.yay for abortion yay for homelessness .
Conservatives like gynotician Genius refuse to acknowledge Scheer's voting history or the antichoice resolutions in CPC policy . Sadly , media seems uninterested in it either .
Closer in terms of time and space , we can look at how Planned Parenthood ( blessed be they now ) in the UK , US , Canada , etc . were made to control the reproduction of Black and indigeneous people .

If you don't like abortion , don't get one .

@baimcpher There ’ s a reason why a lot of anti-choice people get abortions themselves .
If anti-choice people really cared about babies they'd be doing everything possible to end domestic violence . According to the CDC , 20 % of pregnant women in the US experience physical violence from their partner . Doctors say the violence is often directed at the belly .
@ComradeJiggly @dante_verita @rhetanddisc Wow that's actually dumber than most pro-choice arguments . Most will say it's not killing " of a human " or something but will at least be smart enough to acknowledge that it's ending the life of a living being , even if it's dehumanized to " cell clump " or whatever . Congrats .
Sooo I guess everybody ’ s in a pretty good mood over there at NRA Headquarters today ? Also , can you imagine the outcry if Planned Parenthood of the Teamsters tweeted something that targeted a citizen who ’ s just trying not to get dead ? This is insane & its time to nix the NRA .
According to this prolife group , passing the equal rights amendment that would make women equal under the constitution , would be a “ step back ” . It ’ s not solely about abortion and was creased back in the 1900s . I love when prolife admits to their women hating ways . prochoice

@beachlifeRN I don ’ t dispute that its an agenda . The problem is that you can ’ t stop them by exaggerating .

It ’ s 100 % possible to be personally pro-life but politically pro-choice . Because I understand that the only person I have the right to make that decision for is me , not everyone else .
@SecPompeo Take your prolife stance and shove it . The only thing you all care about is money .
@FrHilderbrand I don't care about politics , either . I do care about abortion and the Democrat Party , " The Party of Abortion " . For that reason , I can never vote for a Democrat nominee , because they all support the Party of full-term abortion and infanticide . Wait , I do care about politics .

@DrSteveJacobs @mkt293 @dylrschn @LeahNTorres As someone who personally had the procedure later than I wanted to because of economic and geographic barriers to access , I'm grateful that study is shining light on the way restrictive anti-abortion laws make it harder for people to access the procedure early when it is safer .

Yo my son is 3 weeks old and I'm here to say that I would willingly get an abortion and will support anyone around me who wants to get one . I had my one , I'm content with my life the way it is . Don't speak for all mothers pal
@nixheathen @sentientdreamer @ChristieLea @Stressied_Out @lloomer80 Because we shouldn't be able to intentionally kill 800,000 children per year . If there is evidence of the mother's life being threatened then abortion has to be a necessary option , as bad as it is .

@andrewcstewart @AshaRangappa_ @JamesAGagliano It's not independence when Trump nominates judges with a slant on immigration , pro-life , etc . And some of his nominees had little experience . Republican Sen . Kennedy outed one of them , but how many were pushed through by Moscow Mitch ?

@JJMcLaughlinGrp @StuntQueenAgncy @jumprjintally @AOC By restricting access to birth control and abortion ?
@ReyannaRice @iowaliberty @JamesMartinSJ But the issue is that certain issues are more urgent . Things l like healthcare , immigration , climate change , etc are all important but abortion is a much more egregious act as it is the intentional killing of an innocent human . We can have a discussion on what the best way is to -

@stlpcs Abortion is legalized murder ! Punish the murderers ! Man abortions illegal throughout the USA ! @LibbyCMason
@peterdaou What are you not understanding ? Abortion should be secure , safe , affordable , free from violence , or discrimination . There should be counseling before , and after for all . This is the key to good care . Medicare is another whole issue . Millions are still unable to afford healthcare
The hearing notes reference the battle over Missouri's last abortion provider + the restrictions that could force it to close . This closure would make Missouri the first state without an abortion provider , forcing patients to seek care out-of-state .

It ’ s been really telling to see how many anti abortion people are willing to compare having an abortion to how we used to enslave POC ... absolutely not the same thing and if you actually view fetal development at par with that , unfollow me because our ethics will never line up .

@Mclobster72 @Independent_ie It affects every person who pays for abortion through ( their taxes ) under the guise of a lie . It's not healthcare , it never was and never will be . It's the deliberate act to end a life . Is that enough or do you want more ?

Reproductive coersion isn't new and should not be tolerated in any form . Banning abortion is the same corrosive tact used by governments to force abortion or to cap birth rates . Its all the same loss of bodily autonomy for women .

@DontTreadOnBaby @Arachne646 @glimmer017 @ReproRights Abortion ends the pregnancy , thus stopping the development of an infant . You may hold a religious belief that a fertilized egg has a soul ( as decreed in 1869 by Pope Pius 9th ) but that is merely a religious belief and not based on science .

It would be so much nicer if Congress passed the Bill preventing infanticide of children who are born alive after abortion . Children are so much more important than animals . Congress should know this !

@GarnettGenuis It really doesn't lack clarity at all . It means you believe the social structure and social rights should be the way they were in the past . Typically that means a weaker Bill of rights , anti-abortion , anti-immigration and against helping others outside your group .
@NayNuhOrdinary @DearMontoya @NobodybutChelz I ’ ve heard that abortion can also cause you to have higher risks for breast cancer & reproductive issues later on in life . You ’ re right . Your body has went through several changes to prepare you for pregnancy . Suddenly removing a fetus will most likely cause some sort of damage .
@YAM_PPFNigeria Health is " a state of complete physical , mental , and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease " as indicated by @WHO so in essence , if the pregnancy infringes on any of these , then the person is not healthy . abortion becomes a healthcare right .

This hearing takes place against an alarming background : Since January 2011 , state policymakers hostile to abortion rights have enacted 484 new abortion restrictions . This onslaught has shifted the abortion policy landscape dramatically .
@almostjingo @steph93065 @GOP I guess when a state votes in a governor that wore blackface when he was younger , advocates for after birth abortion ( murder ) , there is no chance a Republican could compete in that state .
Too bad their parents didnt believe in abortion or at use reliable birth control .
Which shows you they're not fighting abortion per se . They're fighting abortion without SHAME - - without apology - - without showing obeisance to the patriarchal power structure .
Abortion is responsibility , and not anyone else ’ s business .
A majority of people who are Pro Choice do not understand the process of exactly what happens when an abortion occurs . Please educate yourself on what happens to the BABY . These children are gruesomely murdered , being torn apart limb by limb . Pro Life Stand Firm

@inflammateomnia @SteveSkojec it might " win over " people who have already been brainwashed by feminist ideology , but only at the expense of glossing over foundational principles . And then what ?

@kneeclayspeaks @DaphGillentine @DrAshSaleh @SierraDeciduous Being pro-choice means you approve of the choice to kill helpless human beings . That's forcing death on someone , violating their right to life and right to bodily autonomy , and doing so when they are at their most vulnerable . That's not opinion , that's fact .
@Pro_life_ANCAP " So you want school choice , gun choice , religious exercise choice , taxation choice , health insurance choice , union choice ? " " lololol no just abortion , but don't call me pro-abortion you forced-birther "
Looks like Virginia may end up like CA since the Governor , the House , and the Senate will all be controlled by Democrats . On the road ahead : higher taxes , gun control , abortion on demand ( even after birth ) , $ 15 minimum wage , sanctuary cities , and removal of Confederate monuments .
@TallHappyDad @dccra As a pro-life person , aren't you able to factor in the 99.999 % of lives on Earth rather than just the lives that end with abortion in the US ?
Y'all really want kids to starve cause the parents are poor or crappy . Usually the same pro-life crew .
@bluesidesoul @dihelling @MichaelTowery @LilaGraceRose The choice for death is a very sad choice , indeed . When women who conceive in rape & then abort are interviewed 5-10+ years out , most have very deep regret for aborting . Friends had often pushed them into abortion at the time . It didn't make the rape " go away . " It cost them joy .

@KitControversy @JCarl199250 @jasonpaisley @Hurricaneheat1 @beppababel @marclamonthill That responsibility shouldn ’ t fall on citizens .

The GOP loss in the VA doesn ’ t mean prolife is losing . It shows the trouble the VA GOP continues to be in , the left is serious about taking over states since we have been so effective , & that we must pay the same or more attn to state legs as DC . Thus , why I launched @SFLAaction

@RedHatty_Social I ’ d never say “ state ’ s rights ” about voting ! It ’ s the states that have suppressed voting rights for decades . Basic rights like voting , reproductive rights , marriage , housing , & education cannot be left to the states , we ’ re a nation , not a confederacy .

@flo767676 @TitaniaMcGrath I ’ d say the same about Planned Parenthood workers .
@hansjelbert1 Exactly . They like to pretend pro choice is the same as pro abortion . Nobody is pro abortion .
So , i found some reps that saying , “ so they ’ re gonna repeat ? Bcs some ppl are agree abt abortion ? ” The ans is , it ’ s depends on themsleves . Gini , kalo mereka kapok they maybe will had sex with consern ( using protection , etc ) or not .
@DavidJHarrisJr There is nothing healthy or great about having an abortion especially for the baby . It is murder and Hollywood is sick .

@RomagnoliEsque The major difference is that with a tumor , the host's life is at risk . The ONLY circumstance I would consider abortion is if the mother's life is at risk of being ended . I would pose the question to the mother and she , ( not I ) , will decide if she wants the baby to live or not .

Je kunt hiervan zeggen wat je wil , maar deze man is tenminste eerlijk . Hier draait het om . De pro-choice beweging is geen beweging voor vrouwen , maar tegen het ongeboren leven . Ze geven er niet om , het heeft geen bestaansrecht . Bedankt Daan , voor deze eerlijke erkennen .

@chloeyloman @deniseharle @Essos_Westeros @Rachelhodder @Sam_DeLoach @Antihumanswhop1 @luckyhubbyguy But if a woman is “ pro-choice ” she is choosing for another person . Her baby . It ’ s evil .
Since Roe v Wade , abortions have dropped and more people say they are ' pro-life ' .
@lizzwinstead @MotherJones Another thing that bothers me is that calling anti-choice people " anti-abortion " implies that anyone who defends the pro-choice position--legal & safe access to abortion - - " favors " abortion in some morally simplistic sense .

@MilosMaridalen Banning abortion just means banning abortion for poor people ... middle class and rich can always find ways .
@LifeNewsHQ What's the point of communion if he still supports abortion ? Life begins in the womb . " I knew you before you took shape in your mother's womb . " Psalm 139:16

@LaurenBrns @JuliusGoat @mattyglesias So you ’ re taking the Bernie route of including women ’ s reproductive rights / autonomy in the “ single issue interest ” , not a “ real issue ” category .

@spulliam @LauraMiers @IlanaPL I am strongly pro-choice but I hope this is really true and if so , great ! If anti-abortion activists focus on preventing unplanned pregnancies with science and advocating for childbirth in a non-coercive , truthful way then , you know , great .

@calebtvofficial @NowSpissed Okay , kid , you go on believing that women don't deserve rights to bodily autonomy . You go on prioritizing a fetus over the woman . And also , killing is illegal , and abortion isn't so the two terms are not synonymous

@Rachelhodder @mynamesarthur sure that's why planned parenthood is deathly afraid of accurate and realistic information of abortions and depictions of abortions contrast that with , for example , the killing of livestock for meat--which people have done for their families literally for millennia

@1MilanCo Sure will and get a damn abortion ... 😂 😭 😭 😂 😂 it don ’ t say have his baby
It's totally disgusting that the MSM isn't covering this story . They are so biased . I remember when I first started doing pro-life work and I was told how biased the MSM was . I didn't believe it . What a fool I was .
Republican's aren't trying to please the masses . They aren't even trying to please a majority . They pander entirely to a reliable voting base that holds them hostage over guns and abortion .
Exactly ! ! Abortion is not women ’ s healthcare ... it ’ s the murder of an innocent human being !
@EddieRispone @realDonaldTrump @JohnBelforLA That's hilarious . He's such a radical liberal he signed one of the most conservative anti-choice bills into law .
I ’ m convinced that they legit think anyone who “ gender conforms ” does so because they ’ re brainwashed . The same as pro-life women are suffering from internalized misogyny .
All of use . Refuse to be divided by STUPID stuff like sexuality , gender , if you agree with abortion or not . Who the fuck cares at this day and age . Live and let live . You do what you want to do , let others do what they want too .

@HylianApologist Again , it ’ s unfair to say “ force ” . A pregnant woman put on an isolated island will eventually go into labor . Nobody forced her to do so . Nature will have its way .

@JCAKE12 @BryanKemper Veganism is against reproductive exploitation . Using hens & cows as breeding machines to get our eggs & milk is immoral .

@focus_lit @TravisPeterJack @LisaWinslow @HeidiM_67 @Lilies09 @d3_valenzuela @Stacy_g52 @akjr1995 @Downeyangel @JVaghyJones @SteffenFinch @ImpeachNow7 @theladykatie @SierraDeciduous @SlsStudios @Samanth47173446 @JCAKE12 @lloomer80 You made that up . Weird how the anti-abortion movement attracts loonies and misogynists , exclusively .
@AOC Some asked if this is the drag queen that staged that gruesome fake abortion video that went viral . No , according to this gay news site , that's another drag queen .
Morgen in Dresden Podium " On abortion : Whose body is it anyway ? " und hier im Livetsream
RT " Abortion is on the ballot today , and it ’ ll be on the ballot next year too . Add your name and tell MSNBC and washingtonpost to talk about abortion at the next Dem Debate . " via womensmarch
@jennifermjones @nathansparkling Yes , problem is she has a platform of sorts , a bit of influence . It's not just her - McAlpine is inviting them in with this insidious LGBAlliance with links to Heritage Foundation . They are anti-LGBT , pro-life , climate change deniers and embedded in the Trump administration .
I wonder whatever happened to that pro abortion lady who said she was going to donate $ 20 to Planned Parenthood every time a pro lifer responded to her ... she got up to like $ 600 😂 😂 😂
Planned Parenthood Sex-Ed Not Radical Enough , AISD Proposes Canadian Curriculum to Indoctrinate Children | Texas ValuesTexas Values
Planned Parenthood has ONE BILLION dollars in assets Yet , They don't own a single mammogram machine Perform less than 2 % of the nation's breast exams Perform less than 1 % of all Pap tests But commit 39 % of the nation ’ s abortions Let's stop pretending @PPFA cares about women
@Shakkh1r @dbfs @MSNBC Your tears are even more delicious ! And I draw the line at abortion ... how about you ?
It was not an easy choice . But it was the one she felt was best for her and for her children . I am grateful that she had the right to make that decision . That choice should be the right of every woman , not politicians . Her story is why I am proudly pro-choice .
@ColtsCarolina @LibSelfOwns @realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog @yaf I still see " pro-abortion " ( as you call it ) debates going on around here , though . Did Matt lie to us ? It's difficult to take his future arguments seriously , if so .
Victory for health ! A Trump administration rule that allowed physicians and nurses to refuse care to people on religious grounds - - contraception , abortion , anti-HIV or STD meds , use of stem cells , etc - - is ruled illegal and unconstitutional . Hooray .

I know someone knows someone who needs to see this .. please share
A day late and a dollar short . There are too many awakes to the truth . Guess the only thing you ’ re concerned about is the adrenochrome . Skank .
Ann Rossiter , 75 , pro-choice activist for 55 years , co-founded an underground London-Irish network that helped Irish women access safe abortions in the UK in the 80s and 90s . She tells me she is shell-shocked at decriminalisation in NI . The North Is Now
@charliekirk11 That's why planned parenthood funneled him $ 5M for his race .
I'm going for an abortion on Thursday . Congress . I want them aborted ...
@HookIreland @ellenmcoyne Why are you sharing a picture from an article about the British educational system ? Would you call forcing children to learn Maths anti-choice ?
@AontuIE I hope you get those seats . Sinn Féin are an embarrassment . Their overly left liberal policies nauseate me as I'm sure it does so many pro-life nationalists . All the best 2 the party on your aspirations .
@My_Trigger11 @Christophercsa6 @My_Trigger1 @ConnieBeesHeart @DFBHarvard2 @cheri4trump @bill_donaghy @XArmandKleinX @BaconChocolate3 @proMAGAitalians @highmilage57 @NeensCa @DwQken @Foxlink78 @Prolife_IAM @Freedom2713 @Nobodybutme17 MACA - Make Assholes Cry Again !
That's hominy . A hymen is a federal law that bans insurance coverage for abortion .
Turns out Healthcare is a Pro Life issue .
@Drummer873 @NikkiHaley 5 . Sexism - “ Grab em by the pussy ” , male-dominated cabinet , anti-abortion judges , rolling back LGBTQ protections

THREAD 2 / x Almost immediately after the election , the opening gambit for the poison pill was played . " We should have dragged Scheer to a Pride parade . That hurt us in the GTA . Abortion hurt us in Quebec ; same-sex marriage hurt us in the GTA . " - CPC anon
@KPyniu @neuropek Dla mnie jest względne . Bo to co jest dobre dla mnie niekoniecznie będzie dobre dla kogoś innego . Np . Dla mnie dobre jest pogaństwo , inni nie znajdą w nim harmonii . Dla mnie dobre jest pro-choice , dla kogoś będzie to złem .
@mspricklefinger @emilylhauser Neither the mother , nor baby would survive the baby coming anywhere near close enough to viability . The unfortunate necessity to remove an ectopic is not an abortion or anything like it . Nor is there any way to induce delivery . Stop trying to equate this to abortion .
People be born to parents who don ’ t want kids but were too stubborn to get an abortion
