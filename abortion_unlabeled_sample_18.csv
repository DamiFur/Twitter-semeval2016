@JReubenCIark @JPBellum That ‚Äô s why I distinguished between the two earlier . Obviously you think women who subscribe to abortion shouldn ‚Äô t vote , but do you think women should just completely have that right revoked at large ?
@checkmatestate pro-life means you cannot be a liberal . doesn't matter if every other position aligns with them , the left doesn't all people who believe in the sanctity of life in their party .
I will never not be amazed at the fact that some men still think their opinions matter on abortion and women's health
And note how the TV can also be deployed to eradicate inconvenient people , such as the humans destroyed in abortion . The TV has drawn us into a simulation that represents this grotesque golden circle regime as normal . The TV has become an instrument of concealment & control .
@WordswithSteph So sad that many evangelicals are being duped for votes . They are pro-life but fight gun control which takes life . They are anti-LGBTQ but their President supports this demographic . They claim God is love and family values but tear immigrant families apart . Really ?

@scrowder Ignorance also triggers us . Ignorance that you think PP is the only abortion provider , that you think that is all they do , and that you think because some religious people believe life begins at conception , everyone must believe it . Freedom of religion also means freedom from it .

@og_dbl_lo_g @h8Wankmaggot45 3 . As a child born to an unwed mother who did not have a right to choose ( prior to 1969 ) , my positions on abortion are complicated .

Let's get this straight . Democrats vote for a bill to stop the abuse of pets ( that's good ) but block the bill to stop Infanticide Why are they all in on killing American babies & replacing our population with foreigners ? This is an easy one & it's not about reproductive rights .

@Johnthemadmonk there has been a diabolical infiltration across many christian denominations it appears . Now people cannot assume self-described " Christians " are not actively pro-abortion .
@LeahNTorres apparently can ‚Äô t handle the truth that abortion quite literally kills a living human baby . What kinda of dilemma is it when a ‚Äú doctor ‚Äù ignores medical FACT to assuage her own conscience ?

@SchaferGino @Mlaldridge68 @ABC There are more reasons to get an abortion than just " I don't want a baby yet " , though that should be all the reason you need since , if you're not mentally , emotionally , or financially ready for a child , that will have a big negative impact on the development of the kid

Abortion does not heal trauma . Abortion does not administer justice . Abortion simply inflicts a 2nd act of violence against the woman & an innocent child .

@alberta_fat @rockdoc666 @GlobalEdmonton @RachelNotley @jkenney Well according to you if I do get pregnant , even though it would disrupt my life and education , I should keep the pregnancy if I cannot afford out of pocket costs to terminate .

Welcome to the pro-life movement Kanye . prolife Kanye West
You don ‚Äô t care because the little girl who ‚Äú mani mani and breed cause she has no ambition ‚Äù will likely not be your child . Inaccessible birth control or access to safe and health abortion will never be your issue . Giving everybody equal access to information is not your agenda .
@FeeleyTrisha We do have some good people running . I think Warren and Sanders will devide the country even more . And Biden is past his time . I don't think he will reverse the Orange Stain's attacks on Planned Parenthood !
@CookCookie @xr_cambridge They could just as easily be protesting abortion .
@MurrayJCampbell I know some very well . Others I asked . They admitted to not doing anything prior . During the debate , keyboard warriors refused to discuss actual methods for reducing abortions and simply demanded you identify as ‚Äú pro-life ‚Äù or ‚Äú pro-choice ‚Äù as if the label was all that mattered .
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yep . Group think is supported on the left ... if you can call what Dems do ‚Äú thinking ‚Äù . The party of abortion , no borders , and food stamps . Losing our country if they win .
Interesting that the people campaigning for abortion are alive !

@ruqaiya_h One thing I find ironic is when some muslims look down on the whole Pro-Choice issue . Doesn't Islam allow abortions for any reasons other then financial ones ? As long as it's done within 4 months . anything after that abortions would only be allowed if a mothers life is in danger
Recently , one St . Paul couple decided to take countering the anti-choice messaging into their own hands and the Minnesota Billboard Project was born .

@salyers_maryana Totally agree . It's a watershed issue : If a person is wrong on an obvious issue as the immorality of abortion , then they cannot be trusted on other issues . HOWEVER , just because a person MAY BE pro-life , that does not mean they will GET my vote . Pro-choice : No Pro-life : Maybe

prolife has no say in whether a person gets an abortion or not . They have no say in why someone can get an abortion or not . Women can choose abortion for any reason they please and those reasons do not need the validation or approval of others . prochoice

@aviatorwriting @LilaGraceRose Sorry not sorry to say this but abortions are very common in California and people are suffering from poverty . Children are suffering from starvation in India . A place where a woman can have an abortion and not be judge for that . Perhaps you'd like to explain why ? Silence ? Hahaha
@christmas_lewis They would have to be perfectly aligned with my views in every other way and I still don't know . Their ' pro-choice ' would absolutely have to be limited to the first trimester . I don't agree with it , but it's possible the other candidate is worse .

Perhaps another step in there might be to reject rational thinking for emotionalism in every level of school , from kindergarten to college .

@angelodealban I personally think abortion should be an option , especially those who are struggling nutritionally and financially . Anyway , this can also be prevented if there is proper execution of sex education among pre-teens and teenagers . This could also lower the prevalence of STIs .

DEMOCRAT PLATFORM SEEMS TO HAVE NO LIMITS ON ABORTION , MIGRATION , VOTING , SPENDING ON FREE STUFF ... But they sure want to limit : Free speech if you disagree , limit arms & self-defense , law enforcement , limit Citizen rights , the Constitution ...

According to @PPact ' s 2017-2018 annual report , America's largest abortion provider performed 332,757 abortions but offered only 9,055 prenatal services . Planned Parenthood is not in the business of helping pregnant women . Planned Parenthood is in the abortion business .

After 45 years , abortion is the most systemic institutional racism in US history . 36 million black & brown babies , 300-500 K / yr , 1,300 / day , 50 / hr . Why would a racists / white supremacists oppose abortion with these numbers ? Kanye is right , those for abortion are oppressing minorities
@dalesamples @TheBabylonBee No , Dems say women should be allowed to have an abortion * if they thenselves choose to . * It's not the same thing as advocating * for * it .

@cspanwj Abortion at 9 months ? ? ? That's called murder . Some ppl will believe anything .
@JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Brennan the Traitor & @comey are behind Spygate , Coup attempt , & infanticide . Coup emboldened PP & the abortions industry . There is evidence that many " aborted " babies are born alive then murdered - in order to harvest intact body parts for sale
@PinkNews Incredibly offensive . The article attempts to claim that only pro-life groups are criticising , but being pro-choice does not mean you don't acknowledge that abortion is a sad and painful experience . Very unfortunate someone has decided to be gratuitously offensive in this way .
Today , committees in South Carolina and Ohio are voting to enact harmful abortion bans and restrictions . In case you needed a reminder , voting matters .
@LambdaLegal @HHSGov It's OK to DISCRIMINATE against one's child by CHOOSING to pay to have him / her murdered w / impunity before s / he's born while collecting > $ 400 Million / yr from the gov't , but not OK for Prolife Christian entities protected under the 1A to choose to obey the Word of God ?

@TheTrueWorldLLC @PaperFoxx @AdversityGift @EquityForward FFS , have some respect for other faiths . I don ‚Äô t base my stance on abortion solely on my religious beliefs . I only get bent out of shape when people use Christianity to disenfranchise others when the Bible says nothing of the sort .
@NYCMayor I ‚Äô m just curious why the abortion proponents and advocates are always elitist whites ?

@KitControversy @chrisolitics @JCarl199250 @Hurricaneheat1 @beppababel @marclamonthill The bills are de facto abortion bans because the ones being passed do not permit for rape or incest or even the health and life of the mother AND most women do not know they are pregnant until 6 weeks when the heartbeat begins .
