@eclecticbrotha Tulsi Gabbard is hailed as a progressive champion . But her views on Islam & support for far-right leaders suggest otherwise . Her questionable loyalty to LGBT & abortion rights is disquieting considering her public reputation as a beacon of progressivism .

@amvetsupport guns and abortion ... but there's also a real deep-seated hated for " liberals " and mocking them has become an encouraged sport with trump in office
@AllahUniversal That R Kelly abortion song !
The more draconian the rhetoric on reproductive rights , the worse the care for mothers and babies . Do we have a paradox here ? Shadow Network
Wow . Missed the entire election because I was in clinic , but finally leaving in tears . After 4 years of terrible abortion bans and laws , Kentucky finally has a pro-choice governor . So proud of all the organizers and activists that made this happen , especially @PPAdvocatesINKY .
Something both prolife and prochoice can support .
@sambooklove @SlimSmith5 You are exactly right . I've been in churches that literally say " you can't be pro-life and a democrat " . Outside of race , abortion is the predominant factor in Mississippian's party affiliation .

@Rusty3291 @jgeigerselva @cmclymer @DonaldTrump Wow . First of all : abortion is not murder , it is heath care . Second , ‚Äú political correctness ‚Äù is treating everyone with respect . Third , being ‚Äú woke ‚Äù is , again , treating people with respect . So you basically want to be able to not treat people with respect ?
Abortion is BIG BUSINESS , if your pro-choice make sure you know ... I find this disgusting , I wonder if you get an abortion can you keep the remains to keep it out of these peoples reach . Profiteers off of your tragedy

Hello Missouri . Turns out your state health director has been personally tracking the menstrual periods of Missouri women , on a spreadsheet . This is how your state govt is " regulating " the last abortion provider in MO - - while trying to shut it down .
Also counseling for rape victims . And basically everything else that @PPFA offers ( that Everyone else uses as a defend for planned parenthood ) but without the abortion part . That way not only does everyone win but including the innocent human lives . No killings . Just love & help .

@RightToLifeUK @LibDems @LibDems I ‚Äô m not really into single issue politics , but if it is true that a candidate can be deselected for the broad-brush of their pro-life values , then that speaks volumes about your values - or lack of - and may then mean that you lose the chance for my vote .
The Republicans have gotten everything they wanted from Trump ( repeal of DACA , Dismantling EPA , undermining abortion rights , taking down Obamacare ) and they just have some small impeachment issues to deal with . Small price to pay . So who can lead the fight back ?

@billingsgazette Steve gets donations from taxpayers through DOT , counties , municipalities , Planned parenthood and many more taxpayer funded programs ! ! Billings Gazette needs to be honest on their reporting ! Look for yourself ! !
Adding to this - If we're going to focus on the " complexity " and the " difficult decisions " of abortion ( true for many people , of course ! ) we have to also support the fact that for many others , abortion can be something to shout or to explore in standup comedy .

If Republicans don ‚Äô t get control ! ! It want be long the whole country will look like if not worse than California ! People need to get out and educate the younger voters ! We are going to have to work really hard in 2020 ! !

@SenSchumer @slnuelken So much for Republicans being " pro-life " , huh ?
@EdMcQuade11 @ZubyMusic So by that logic , I and all other women would support abortion , but that ‚Äô s not true . Also , none of that would change the fact that abortion is the killing of innocent human life .
@ScottFordTVGuy @realDonaldTrump I'd ONLY vote for Donald Trump - Bloomberg is a mess - as a pro-life Catholic I could never vote for any of the Democrats who are all for killing babies up to and after the time of birth .
Planned Parenthood will also be collecting donations before the event outside of Moudy N 141 for unopened and unscented packages of tampons and pads to help out TCU APO and @tcu_sage !

I don't WANT pregnancies to be terminated . I'm pro choice . What I WANT is for the woman who's uterus is in question to make her own decision .
@PPFA In a 2015 testimony , Richards herself told Congress that they can only refer women to outside facilities to receive a mammogram .

@TheFakestAlfred pro abortion arguments frames abortion as a ‚Äú way out ‚Äù ticket which misinforms most young women on the realities of the after math of it .

@realTT2020 @WhiteHatGuy Not who I thought he was . It sickens me . He says he may be the last GOP pres . He voted for neither in 2016 , depriving a vote to pro-life cause .

@KristineWahl @AstriusCatyote @SkjeidyBrady @Pro_life_ANCAP @LeahNTorres Sorry , I thought you were finished when I responded . For clarification , are you saying abortion ( killing of humans in utero ) is justified because society has issues managing our lives - or because there isn't enough emphasis on maternal wellness ?
@Atsinganoi I do imagine there's not much published academic material pushing for anti-abortion .
@Astrodomania @AbbyJohnson Not everyone who makes use of planned parenthood believes in god So by u saying tht decisions should be made based on YOUR religion is wrong . What planned parenthood is doing is not pushing abortion , they are providing a safe procedure for woman who wish to have an abortion ..
Women just lie so much , abortion makes ur vagina ugly ?
@3rdGermanGov Unless you're under the assumption you can give or take away rights to trans people in your nation , then there's literally no point in debating it . Unless you have a registered GP with a right to perform surgery , you shouldnt be debating abortion etc etc etc . Be realistic dude .
Chuds in my mentions saying crap like ‚Äú virginity tests at OBGYN clinics aren ‚Äô t sexual assault . ‚Äù An adult woman ‚Äô s sexuality isn ‚Äô t a determination of health or worth in society , doing that promotes systemic misogyny : it ‚Äô s an attack women ‚Äô s reproductive rights and bodily autonomy .
@darrencgilbert @CoreysDigs @jennifer_0780 The left are attacking homeschool , charter schools and private schools now .. parents need to stand up and sue the public schools districts , get planned parenthood , LGBTQ and the ACLU out of the schools that are using gender identity through K - 12 .

@Megadogyourmom4 @xmjones100 @ReedNelson9 @_celia_bedelia_ You don't have the right to demand a woman terminate her pregnancy because of you'd rather not be a dad .

@CritFlaild20 @LeahNTorres @denisewills Why do you hide beyond legal terms like " person " instead of simply dealing with the reality that it's the termination of human life ? My tweet simply said that abortion , by definition , ends life . If you don't disagree , I don't know why you responded .
Aren ‚Äô t politicians meant to be intelligent ? Politicians debate changing ' pregnant women ' to ' pregnant people '
@ebleas @LeahNTorres All of that is what abortion provides . It helps to maintain and restore the physical , mental and emotional well being of the one who is pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy . Forcing them to remain pregnant against their will enforces physical , mental and emotional trauma
@Salty_tbh @TechKiwiGadgets @NewshubNZ This is Abortion Legislation . Not relevant to transwomen . 0-1 transmen give birth each year . Mostly 0 . Whose rights are we circumventing by demanding that language is not obscured in a bill about women ‚Äô s reproductive rights ?

@blackmeowt @CNN Not my responsibility when people have unprotected sex . Have control of your body then - abstain or use protection . Abortion shouldn't be birth control . Yes , a fetus is human . Whether you like it or not .
@YoginiCamper @Pro_life_ANCAP @Sam_DeLoach @_celia_bedelia_ it doesn't make any distinction . Or it would be noted . The problem with choosing any moment after conception is that all you have gradual continuous development of a body .

idk this is super fucked up imo . they're also extremely anti-choice and think that you need to practice abstinence if you're not ready for a child . and they refuse to use birth control bc of religion . which has caused a lot of issues . but that's for another day .

@DavidJHarrisJr I do think a woman should be able to get an abortion . What I don ‚Äô t think is right is when certain people use it as a form of birth control and get them over and over again .

Not every woman can recover from an abortion . Also some women are old and an abortion may reduce their chances of conceiving again . Others have done so many abortions that the doctors have warned them to stop . Others , abortion goes against their faith and values . Simple .
credible doctors say affirming a trans child's gender identity is healthy and just , and a jury agreed . but the guy who defrauded the kid's mom into marriage / locked his stepkids in their bedrooms cried to a pro-life website , so he gets his way .

So sad that it's the pro-abortion side that champions the right of LGBT people not to be discriminated against . Until that changes , and pro-lifers stop trying to make the lives of LGBT's miserable , the pro-life movement will never win over the public , ESPECIALLY young people

The ultimate meaning of ICPD25 Nairobi Summit is perhaps in its holding . A defiant message from all who believe in basic human rights for all women & girls and refuse to be bullied by the unfortunately still so many negative voices out there . The struggle is a permanent one .
@BethMooreLPM Pretty simple , really . No candidate who supports abortion will ever get my vote .
Pls say some prayers for the woman scheduled to abort saturday , that she'd accept help and choose life . And for the family who I'm trying to help avoid eviction . They're truly the greatest family and I want the best for them . ‚ù§ Ô∏è
@mattyglesias Which cultural views , Matt ? I think we ‚Äô d all love to hear which cultural views you ‚Äô d be willing to trade . Are trans people worth fighting for ? Is abortion worth fighting for ? What about immigrants ? You cool with cops shooting black people , kids being shot in schools ? Which views ?
@MTUBlackSheep @evdanker @MSNBC We can add forcing doctors to assist in executions as well ? Why not ? According to pro-abortion logic that would be quite acceptable .
@4TH31ST Better education and resources to prevent unwanted pregnancies is the best solution . But by the time we get to this point in the debate that solution is too late . If abortion is a profound moral failing I think the focus must be on constructive paths for the unwanted child .
@Cernovich This isn't even about " pro " or " anti " vaccine . This is a MEDICAL FREEDOM issue . Why are we letting the government FORCE medical procedures on anyone ? Where there is risk there must be choice . No shots , no school , no public assistance , what's next ?

Planned Parenthood : Performs 83 abortions for every 1 adoption referral Performs 17 abortions for every 1 prenatal service Performs roughly 10 abortions for every " family practice service " Planned Parenthood is not a women's healthcare center . It is an abortion factory

@CaitlinPacific Thank you for reminding us that the most powerful pro-choice argument is that women will start dying again if abortion is made illegal . This is why it was legalized in the first place . I remember . The horror stories were wide-spread , and moved even the religious .
@MyAutismTeam How much you wanna bet that alot of the high childhood mortality in autistics is due to " bereaved parents " murdering their children ? Think that's crazy ? 1/3 of women have had an abortion at some point , and that's according to pro-choice advocates .
@LeahNTorres @DavePellowe There are at least two people alive who were delivered before the cutoff for legal abortion , so you're argument lacks a bit of nuance , turns out , no matter how you look at it , they are people , and the abortionists are a sick death cult .

Religious freedom is a corner stone of American society , but " freedom " to impose your religious belief on others most certainly is not . If a health care worker doesn't want to participate in an abortion , then he / she should leave the health care profession .

@TysonJWhite @t_ftop @hrenee80 Why are abortion centers mostly located in black communities ? Margret Sanger the founder of PP was a real racist , not the BS political narrative racist democrats point to every 4 years .
@KellieShipley @MadamS8N @susannormaokee1 @ArdentFox Do you have proof to back up your üí© ? Abortion doesn ‚Äô t destroy motherhood or families . It allows women to care best for their family . Many women who have abortions have children already .
@jeffswarens @3girlsmommd @McAllisterDen I would like to remind everyone in this thread , in most states at age 12 ! you can have an abortion without parental knowledge or consent . It's the LAW .
My mom just told me some shit that made my stomach turn , people don ‚Äô t have kids if you don ‚Äô t want them , get that abortion . No kid should have to be raised my someone who was guilt tripped into having them ü§∑ üèΩ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è I said what I said , don ‚Äô t @ me
@Fact You also can ‚Äô t have an abortion if you make less than $ 1 million a year
It is also unconstitutional and unconscionable for any legislator to attempt to ban abortion and prevent women from having access to said care . We will fight tooth and nail to protect and uphold Roe v . Wade , expand reproductive rights , focus on black maternal health , etc ;
There is no adequate defense for murder .
@MagTrump2020 @CarolinaSistah @TColluder @SarahBCalif @joncoopertweets I'm not for babies being murdered , I strictly said I'm pro-life . Abortions don't kill babies they " abort " from becoming babies . I'm strongly against partial birth abortions . Bible says life begins at first breath

@detective26AD If girls grow up understanding how to have safe sex , and understanding that the morning-after pill is NOT ABORTION ( it prevents fertilization , just like birth control , and has no detrimental effect on an existing fetus ) , there would be less unplanned pregnancies , less abortion .

I know smart people do not expect even a modicum of honesty from these propagandists but will just point out that they ‚Äô re lying about my article . Read my actual thoughts here :
@AlkalineCheese @rhonda_harbison @RepAdamSchiff Don't try to insult me , you knew what I meant full and well . I have standards and morals and if Schiff succeeds in this scam they won't change . I will never support a President who approves of abortion and it will be my turn to say " that's not my President . "
@tperkins @realDonaldTrump Listen to the Sept 24 statement by the House and then read all the public opening statements . Not one word about pro-life or pro-family . The president violated his oath of office , subverting our foreign policy all for personal gain . Also read the Constitution . The just go away .
@Tinman_73 @keigh_see I am not fine with any murder and I ‚Äô m willing to take steps to stop it . There is a simple solution to the recent school shootings , just like there is for abortion .
Jeremiah 1:5 is nothing to do with abortion or how Americans vote for politicians . If God wants to give out a message on either , there's 30,000+ bible verses in which to make an explicit statement , He didn't and instead you are usurping divine authority to peddle your views .
Sir , abortion is still legal

@Child_Of_Lions @rockdoc666 @GlobalEdmonton @RachelNotley @jkenney I think it does . You don't believe in yourself or your husband - you have already mentioned abortion numerous times if you don't get pregnant when you want . I think that means you don't believe in yourselves and are too scared to overcome a " disturbance " in your lives .
@jeffsosteezy My kids gonna learn about pro abortion at a VERY young age

The dishonesty of the abortion debate is the willful ignorance and unwillingness to call it what it is : discrimination . Debating healthcare access of ANY kind means deciding who we ‚Äô re ok with having it and who we ‚Äô re ok with leaving out . That should be a moral nonstarter .

there it is the prochoice vs prolife fight
