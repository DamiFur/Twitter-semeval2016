I ’ d never force someone to be a parent if they don ’ t want too even though we are both equally responsible HOWEVER , it ’ s my body & you can ’ t decide that I should get an abortion . I ’ ll be a single mom before I let a lame ass nigga who nutted in ME tell me to get rid of my unborn 💯 .

Ridiculous . I guess he should ’ ve been arguing for transgender abortion rights for prisoners instead .
@Romans2v29x30 @Danno_a_Jyd @JamesYo88 No , they aren't . First , most liberals don't " hate God . " 2nd , the biblical god says jack shit about abortion , so that isn't something he's wrong about . But it is ironic that you think it is bad to end the life of a fetus , but are perfectly okay with slaughtering live children .

@tits_and_typos I am so happy for this . I had an abortion when I was 18 from a rape with the most popular guy in college who was in a fraternity . It was in Alabama . They made him look innocent even though I had evidence that it was a product of him . I ’ m so tired of the hypocrites in AL .

Wiem , że wielu ludzi mówi , że Planned Parenthood robi tak dużo i oferuje tak wiele usług dla kobiet . I ja po prostu chcę wiedzieć , dlaczego odmówiono mi zobaczenia tego obrazu . Mówicie , że kobiety przez to nie zmienią swojego zdania . Mówicie o wyborze i tych wszystkich bzdurach .

One main conclusion from my & @rachelj5 ’ s new analysis on self-managed abortion in the US : It ’ s critical to put policies in place that ensure people who self-manage their abortions have the information and support they need .

@OwlinFlight A lot of pro lifers I have come across , already have children or are seriously religious . Never seen one who can't have children of their own . I'm infertile , and I'm pro choice . A person has the right to choose for themselves . Forced pregnancy is wrong !

Republicans seem to be moving , however fitfully or imperfectly , toward a sounder view of economics . Nothing of the sort can be said regarding Democrats and abortion .
@QuoteMeOnThatK @Teddy_Bhaie @ALReproRightsAd @ReproRights Because for you an abortion isn't the killing of an innocent human being . It's a word you use to isolate yourself from what you're advocating for . Why do you care if I say killing an unborn human being if that's scientifically accurate ?
We're are so sad about the loss of our friend Kay Hagan . Kay was in our first class of Featured Candidates back in 1998 . She was a stalwart champion of reproductive rights and women in politics . She made a profound impact on our country and she will be greatly missed .
@joextaposition @ambrosia_omG Lol well forcing pregnancy is kinda lost on my because I ’ m pro-choice . If she doesn ’ t want to be a parent , she has the option to abort the child . That choice , however , is not the man ’ s to make . And it will never be .

@jessradio This has massive connotations for the ways in which women ’ s bodies are policed today . Abortion , surrogacy , genital mutilation , the stigmatisation of women ’ s sexuality , women ’ s domesticity . I think it points towards a fear of femaleness . Moreso than a fear of femininity .

@Yahverse @TheStevenThomas @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow I would . Just because I am personally pro-life doesn't mean that I can or should limit another's views . I can preach and inform , I can counsel and pray , but ultimately it will not be my action or choice .
@MatthewHVoss @TeeDotally dude , that ’ s the shit we ladies have been seeing & hearing FOR AGES . especially enraging when it ’ s bullshit like the politician who said a few years ago that a woman couldn ’ t get pregnant from rape bc the “ body will just shut that down . ” used that as an anti-abortion argument .
@DavidNe99469223 @Me262A1 @Falc0nsGhost @NowSpissed Just because I aam pro-choice does not mean I am pro-abortion . It means I understand that your choice is no one else's business & I will always fight for the right to choose .
@DaylonMathis Abortion is healthcare . Because it's about the health of the pregnant woman . Her mental health . And sometime physical but that's a lower amount . Also rape numbers are also low cause most don't get reported but go off on your privileged rant honey
It is a part of the destruction of US
@woodyfam5 @DrJenGunter @prochoiceforal1 But yes , the whole abortion front is about controlling language . That's why I subvert their language at every opportunity .
@lifeinthegaps To be honest , even though I'm a Republican , I didn't vote for Romney . I almost always vote Republican because of my stance on life . They have to really mess it up for me to go 3rd party . John McCain and Romney were that horrendous unfortunately . Republicans need to be prolife .

@chunkychungus @politico If it's inside your body you have a choice on getting rid of it or not . It's a growth in your body that can't survive without you . Some people choose to assign the concept of a soul onto people , some don't . If an abortion is murder than so is killing any life form .

@jamalgreene Maybe . They've already used this formulation in federal abortion statutes ( like the PBA ban ) that I think are just as questionable constitutionally ( as I don't buy the 14A argument for such laws either ) .

@RDavisJ1 I don't want Roe overturned as much as I want significant restrictions on abortion and zero tax dollars going to planned parenthood . Even if SCOTUS overturned gay marriage , which I don't believe they will , it's a states rights issue and every state legalized it .
Just in case anyone still thinks that anti-choice people aren ’ t misogynists . This is the same state that demanded doctors carry out unnecessary pelvic exams on women seeking abortions . Anti abortion = anti women . Period ( pardon the pun ) .
@robreiner Truth is that abortion takes a life . How do you dispute ?
@W6UNX @WOOZE831 @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox @realDonaldTrump How ? You can't be pro-life and support killing people . Do I need to hand you a dictionary to define " murder " ?
@reproaction You are anti-choice .

@DogPantsMedia @EWErickson Sadly true . If Democrats as a party ever truly embraced a pro-life position , the Republican Party would cease to exist almost overnight .
@peterdaou The Repubs and Dems differ on gays and abortion and immigrants . And that ’ s it ! They use those as hot button topics to polarize voters . Otherwise they are the same party .

Get into these chats friends 🗣 ️ 🗣 ️ 🗣 ️ . We had a good convo about reproductive rights in our nation and abroad and how institutional encroaching on reproductive rights is a function of the patriarchy which very often compromises the lives these institutions ostensibly care for .
It's important for us to express ourselves from the positive , right ? We're one election away from SECURE borders & LAWFULNESS in congress & HONEST ELECTIONS . We're going to nail these election-fraudsters . Dollars to donuts , patriots have got these guys red-handed . Wait & see .

@sophieb07010720 @chloeyloman @Sam_DeLoach @LiamDan36816827 @kbuote98 @Rachelhodder Abortion is racist as hell too . A large majority of abortions occur in minority communities Bc blood sucking ticks like PP pray on them . This is flat out racist
@RexIvyCounty @t8styham Yeah you can't determine whether someone is nice or not based off of the jokes they tell . Abortion jokes . Gay , racial , trans , jokes . Don't care . Everyone and everything in existence can be criticized or joked about . Whether you decide to take offense is up to you .

@TygaRose_Roses Our society frowns upon abortion but if it was made legal we would have very few cases of such deaths .
Pro-choicer here ! This is completely disgusting and vile however no one is seductively playing or “ celebrating ” in the results of an abortion , that is indeed a pro-life talking point . Comparing this extremist act for a certain agenda cannot be compared to an actual abortion .
@BobbyCheeks1 @Truth_Thumper @BaptistCrusad3r @vixmcintyre @PPact @Scotus Nope sorry . You can't just walk in snd say I want one . Not how it works . I tried since age 18 to get a tubal .. was denied . Every time . ( I'm 29 now ) thankfully my husband got a vasectomy . No questions asked . And the planned parenthood near my house doesnt do abortions
@Natalia01Mateo Anyone other than immigrants having children is apparently pushing ' racist Hate Speech ' ; Pro Choice ( a . k . a . ' freedom ' ) is especially aimed at long-established Canadians to reduce their numbers ; Greentards feel guilty about having large families due to the ' Carbon Footprint '
@MattWalshBlog It ’ s amazing that people cheerlead for the state murdering people based on false evidence , unconfirmed rumors , & speculation . Especially when some of those people turn around and pretend to be pro-life . Seek help , dude . Mentally healthy people don ’ t beg for people to be killed .

@DrJenGunter I think they live in some alternate universe - like the individual who unironically referred to themselves as a " pro life anarchist " . You believe the state should force one person to give up bodily autonomy to keep another alive ? Seems opposite of " anarchist " .
@EllianiLualires @AaronTTaylor1 @sheltondesigner @TheLaurenChen This is why good debate topics are those which allow for many different angles in supporting the positions .

@manfromthehand @profswarn @eorlins @MotherJones Yes , you can be opposed to an abortion for yourself and still respect the decisions of others . Pro-choice is about pregnant people choosing what is best for themselves . That's it .

@NSHConservative @nowthisnews Regardless , women should have a right to have an abortion . There are many many reasons for women to want them , many women get them because having a child could kill them or harm them in another way , they ’ ve been raped , etc .
@nat_roxa @debsugar @Dobson253 @mattfoster2010 @KatelynTweeter I am also prochoice to the extent that a woman or a man ( makes no difference to me ) have the freedom to chose anything they want UNLESS it puts in danger another person's life .

This has nothing to do with politics . This has to do with a professed Catholic who publicly admits to supporting abortion being denied Communion by Priest who knows his job .
Government should reward people of faith , life , parents and families and not promote and finance transgenderism , killers , abortionists , kidnappers and abusers . Otherwise is better not to have a government at all !

@mitchellvii What would be the consequences of abortion becoming more costly / difficult to obtain ? Many would use contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancy , while the rest could put their babies up for adoption after birth & get rid of the waiting list of parents that can't have them .
All of the game journalists were super quick to point out that one comment by Kojima that Death Stranding was inspired by Brexit and Trump , but I noticed NONE of them mentioned the pro-life messaging regarding BB .

@EtkinDaniel @tvgirl222 @peterjhasson @ellencarmichael The Church views abortion as not just a sin , but a mortal sin equivalent of murder .

Matt Bevin , now ousted Republican Governor of Kentucky signed a bill to to ban abortion in the state . His willful attacks on abortion access have left the state with 1 clinic . He decimated Medicaid funding that might have covered maternity care . Voters sent their message
@kelleAbond @KySportsRadio Tell me how he isn ’ t moral . Tell me you didn ’ t vote for Bevin just because he said a few disrespectful things about the KEA and teachers . Some of which were true ? Or is it that you believe anytime abortion is moral or higher taxes will be ok ?

@charliekirk11 Neither of them kill kids . Planned Parenthood kills fetuses and zygotes .

@chunkymark Stuff many political folk don't realise are : 1 . the rising generation is " The Pro-Life Generation " , rejecting * " Pro-Choice " groupthink * their mums / grans bought into in 1970s - 90s 2 . Abortion is NOT essential to feminism 3 . It didnt liberate us , Pankhursts + Barbara Castle did .
Cory Booker stated in the debate that he will create an " Office of Reproductive Rights " if elected president . I wonder what this new bureaucracy will do as abortion is currently the law of the land .
@bmaloney7861 @GOP That means voting for politicians who will make a world into which those potential mothers WANT to bring a child into . If you vote AGAINST candidates who support abortion , but FOR those who : - take away SNAP and prenatal care - remove tax deductions for children ( 2 )
@patch1000 @Sammyvdxx @usplaymoney @charliekirk11 I understand both sides of this argument . but for me personally I could not have an abortion . If I still felt I could not keep the child I would give it to a couple that cant have kids .

I ’ m advocating for a woman ’ s freedom to make a choice for an abortion - the most appropriate means of conducting it is a medical decision .
@DevilDog6326 @Joshua4Congress But abortion never kills people . People have all been born already . Abortion is 14 times safer than continued pregnancy and childbirth , so because childbirth DOES kill people , maternity care isn ’ t healthcare , by your definition ?
I choose to be med free . Here's a tweet from a man who explains his decisions re : meds . I respect his choice & respect those who are anti meds . It costs nothing to spare a thought for others who choose differently to ourselves . We can learn a lot if we read / listen 1/3
Both are , in fact , “ reproductive decisions . ” She said there were no laws restricting men ’ s “ reproductive decisions . ” We have a massive body of laws constraining men from certain “ reproductive decisions . ” I did not equate rape with abortion . That was YOUR ( stupid ) assumption .

@hopeformaybe @Fleacatt @MattMurph24 I feel that opposing universal coverage as an ideological point should be viewed the same as being anti-choice .

@KevinMLevy Does he want to legislate away abortion ?
Think about it . Pence / Ryan is THE classic wet dream team for the real base : the Evangelicals . The rest of the average wing nuts will go along because of the shared interests on gays / god / guns / abortion . All they have to do is get The Orange Shitgibbon out and they naturally fall

Interesting to hear about Swedish best practices working on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights : SRHR is a fundamental basic human right ! Great to have Sweden championing these issues at EU level and globally .
@DC_Rob @tiare808 Doublespeak . The truth is Red States do it all the time the women and minorities . See , abortion rights and voting rights . You are woefully misinformed . Anti-government screeds play conservative Americans and allow deregulation to cause actual short and long term damage .
Where Pro Choice and Abortion Rights morality leads .
@ABC This is the world that Republicans want ... shootings in schools , on the streets ... putting our first responders and police officers in grave danger . Turns out the self-anointed Pro LIFE party really promotes death and weapons of death .
@xan_desanctis @DavidAFrench @TheAtlantic @CaitlinPacific @NRO It's trying to convince prolife people to " be nice " instead of telling the truth . That has never worked and will never work . Contrary to popular belief , guilt and shame are extremely effect methods of discouraging immoral and depraved behavior from sane people .

Depravity uses the evils they endorse to shame the ones they hate . A depraved evil controls you . Repent . Your judgement is at the door . The mark of your father , the father of oxymorons , the devil , is upon you and clearly visible .
Hot take : Denying communion for supporting abortion , but not denying communion to supporters of children in cages or the death penalty is maximum hypocrisy from the clergy of our church's Pro-Life ministry . It just exposes political divides in the faith

@MattWalshBlog As much as people probably won ’ t agree with me here , it ’ s the women ’ s choice . For example if she was raped . She can ’ t get the abortion herself - way too dangerous . if it was you in the position , what would you say ? I ’ d say abortion . It ’ s the women ’ s choice , not yours . Hers .
“ So if your daughter was raped you ’ d make her keep the baby ? ? ? ” ( Gotta love horrid hypotheticals ) No . Ideally , I would raise her in such a way that abortion would simply not be an option for her in the first place so there would be no need to give my input .
Great thread .
@Sam_DeLoach @DrSteveJacobs @LeahNTorres Abortion is protected by the rights to bodily integrity and to make decisions about family . The Court explained that decades ago .

@dante_verita @rhetanddisc No if someone engages in sex without the intent of having children , and abortion services are available and affordable then they do not owe that person giving birth anything , they are the ones choosing to have the child .

@baimcpher @QuantifiedDave @BeeAmellia Considering a very large majority of people that are “ pro-life ” bring religion and god into the discussion , it has a very large correlation actually :-D
The abolition of abortion will be discussed at a conference in Killeen . Read more here :
@lushcosmetics You signed a petition basically saying that if Women are pregnant you cannot hire them or keep them employed because you state you favor no bans on abortion because “ Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care , including abortion , threatens the health ,

@ItsGoneAwry So true ! I even add qualifiers - I will legit defend your right to an abortion as long as it is a part of our legal framework , I just morally feel it is rarely ( if ever ) justified . Saying this often gets me inundated with vile dms 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️
@TheRealMomoSan @jotheanimator Yeah , I know , I was asking if he's pro-life or pro-choice
@BernieSanders @shaunking The most important thing any of us can do as adults is to ensure ALL CHILDREN have ALL their basic needs taken care of no matter who they were born to & where they grow up . Adults are obligated to ensure that all children are well taken care of . This is the REAL duty of Pro Life .
Get Covered - but also recognize that the GOP wants to take away coverage for Pre Existing Conditions They also want to deport terminally ill children . So very , very Pro Life these folks , eh ?

@Renevelation He can go find a pro-life girl and father another baby . Hell he can father 60 babies a month if he wants to . Nothing stopping him . But his sperm doesn't get a say about anyone else's body .
Missouri's pro-life bill stops abortions based on race , sex , or Down Syndrome diagnosis . Colleen McNichols , PP Chief Medical officer said their abortionists " “ won ’ t explicitly ask if patients are seeking abortions for prohibited reasons … ”
amelia said herself in episode 2 how scared she was about what happened to christopher happening again and no link telling her she could get an abortion if she wanted is not gonna eliminate years of trauma but yeah let ’ s have her swap updates with bailey that sounds fun <3
@HWoodbery @MSNBC What ’ s “ healthcare ” about murder ? Abortion Is Murder
I ’ ve come to the conclusion that the only reason why prolife is arguing so harshly against virginity not being a social construct is because PP said it wasn ’ t . They can ’ t stand the idea of agreeing with whom they hate the most so they disagree in every aspect . prochoice
@kellster51 @washingtonpost Not if you believe providing an abortion will send you to hell if it's elective ! Or providing any elective medical assistance against your morals !

@maplecocaine Which is funny because Doug Jones voted for that shitty bill this year but he ran as an openly pro-choice Democrat . He ’ ll lose in 2020 but that ’ s not why .
Thank you God for president Trump . Long may his dynasty preside over America . Bless President Trump and guard him in Jesus Holy Name . By his rallies may he forge the Great American ethos that will defeat the sinful Evil De , ocrat manifesto of Communism , abortion , End is Near & Hate .
Thank you , San Francisco , for honoring our state by putting it on your list . Keep your immorality there , it's not welcome here . Walk Away Blexit Black Not Democrat America First
@Annie_7316 @ZubyMusic That's because you were pro-choice and now " pro-life " more accurately , " pro-birth " both for wrong reasons . The truth of the matter is that life has no intrinsic value and some lives are better off not being born . Your entire argument is based on appeal to emotion fallacy .
Abortion is not a party politics issue , the UK stance is not going to change . Why are left wing fanatics turning this country into a place where one can't hold an opinion that differs to their own ?
allat money you putting into them plan bs , you might as well have a baby shower . congratulations , momma . 👶 🏼 🍼
@3rjr52 @LifeNewsHQ That truly sounds like the reason the pro abortion candidate won — by default .
@maryycruz_ @ayy_hogiee @renenlilje @peytnhaag @saltysam01 Pro-choice means you're fine with abortion and a woman's right to choose , both of which you were willing to spend 8 hours trying to convince me how they were bad things .

@_Kenziepuff This makes me so happy . Libertarian and Christian values go hand in hand for me . Like they were meant to . Often , the issue that divides them is abortion . But I'm pro-life & side with those who believe it violates the NAP . Anyway , u just skyrocketed on my list of heroes . Much love
I never opposed state funding for the 211 hotline . I simply suggested ensuring that taxpayer money did not fund the promotion of abortion .
Conforte esto vir ! Happy being a man , heterosexual , Catholic , pro-life , pro-family , conservative , right-wing and everything that implies being politically incorrect . 😎
Good grief .

@Pro_life_ANCAP @StupidRock @AmyAddante There is no comprehensive , adequately funded , sensible plan , anywhere , put forward by anti-choice organizations . If doesn't exist . Because anti choice people want to control , abuse , punish , and shame women far more than they want to care for children .
So American Christians are starting to adopt a nuanced approach to a complex and multifaceted issue ? I'm cool with that !

So called Christians say Trump was made president by God . If they think God would instill an immoral , unethical , lying criminal just b / c he said he was against abortion have their heads buried in the sand . He is the epitome of the Anti-Christ !

@dsparrow22 @EHulderman @MWvonWalter @ShireenQudosi @IlhanMN Yeah because Muslims people are currently the ones trying to infringe on women ’ s rights by making abortion illegal for example or to allow LGBT people to be fired . Don ’ t talk about tolerance by being hypocrite
@davidmweissman Sounds like you're easily fooled . How about articulating why you thought you were conservative to begin with ? Nearly 100 % of the time you're either liberal or conservative at the chemical level . It's not just about policy but how moral you think things are like abortion .
@NikTalazoni I love looking at the nurses at Planned Parenthood in the eye saying I do not use condoms and I would not like any to take home
@caro @LucyFurTweets Just to confirm that production companies have hit rock bottom on ideas , there ’ s a septic abortion coming out that is portraying Emily Dickinson into a modern hipster teen pop star but with period clothes .

is abortion considered weight loss
seriously letting a child sit inside a foster instead of letting them be adopted by a loving family ? “ pro-life ” . what kind of “ life ” are you giving them by taking away the opportunity to be loved ?
@BenWlv @DrMoragKerr Catholic and pro-life to the core , the provision of and promotion of birth control ( though personally I would advocate trying NFP ) and even safe termination ( and pro-life social care advice ) .

@emilyslist It is my body . But I'm smart enough to use birth control & not use abortion as BC . According to the Guttmacher Institute ( PP's own think tank ) 95 % of all women having abortions NEVER EVEN BOTHERED TO USE BIRTH CONTROL !
There ’ s a thing happening where well-intentioned anti-Bevin people are trying to downplay the state government ’ s role in abortion laws and restrictions and I would just encourage you to get a reproductive justice worker ’ s opinion on that before you spout off .

@kevinell31 @universalhub The libs will need lessons in how to cuddle babies once their new abortion policies take effect and kill them all at birth .
@LovesaFlower That is the dumbest thing you've said yet . I'm pro-choice and I don't believe that the free speech of a pro-life advocate should be suppressed . That would make me pro-life , by your count . You DON'T think . What you're doing is nothing akin to thinking .

@TrashPa98954284 @K8TDIDTWO @AP Oh , sure , a 12 - year-old in a troubled family is going to come right out the next day , " I was raped . " YOU should look it up . And abortion does not help a woman who is either physically or mentally unable to give birth--the process isn't simple , it alters one's entire body .
@twashburn15 Not trying to say anything that ’ s the actual truth . Plain and simple . Pro choice can be : “ I would never get one but I wouldn ’ t ever tell someone she shouldn ’ t . ” Pro-life : “ I am against it at all odds . I don ’ t agree with it , and other people shouldn ’ t think it ’ s a choice . ”

@DevDevDevYo @LiveAction It is . I delivered my friends baby that was only 8 - 15 weeks tops . He was a tiny fully formed human being . No mere glob of cells . Abortion is clearly murder if you look at the physical bodies not the propaganda .

@ReyannaRice @rapunzel6977 @mfjlewis Listen how at the 18 min mark in this excellent podcast , Ross Douthat invokes the Consistent Ethic of Life position of the Catholic Church and stops the pro-choice skeptic in her tracks . Proof positive of the amazing power of this argument !

@WSJ " Forced Abortion 40 years in People's Republic of China " In China , " Limit one child from one couple " was held for about 40 years until 2015 . Many pregnant women were forced to abortion .
@JohnAlway @KaitMarieox @optimixmedia And what about the federal and state governments telling a woman how to handle her pregnancy ? No woman gets pregnant without sperm . Requiring reversible vasectomies is just as sound as banning abortion . And insurance covers vasectomies ...

I think you should have the right to do what you'd like with your body , but that the fetus has it's own seperate code of DNA , meaning that it is by all accounts a separate organism .

@CaraJouglard @HellOrBywater Probably there will always be an impasse bw me & ppl who believe abortion is a non-violent , amoral procedure , just healthcare , not the intentional taking of a human life . But there ’ s so much shared ground bc those ppl DO usually at least understand the profundity of potential .
Maybe I'm misremembering things , as I left Christianity behind 20 - some years ago , but I'm pretty sure Jesus said " love one another as you love yourself , " not " destroy other people's property that you disagree with . "

@giant_brain you ’ re comparing a woman ’ s right to an abortion to a human being violating federal law by committing a felony . your comparisons are flawed . i ’ m pro consent , i ’ m anti rape . what ’ s your point here ?

@LpanzaE It could be numerous things . I don ’ t think picking up trash rises to the occasion of hero status . If we want conservative judges we should want them for other issues beyond prolife . Religious liberty is my right to say SS and the acceptance of homosexuality is wrong .

@AnnFuredi @Together4yes I think this is a nuanced debate that those of us who are outside of Ireland only know bits of . I'm glad the referendum passed , I'm sad at how many people are left behind by the legislation , and I'm pro choice on what feeling Repealers have about their lived experience .

Radical Left needs to be stopped .
This idea that people are pro-life out of ' selfish ' reasons is also ass backwards . Another myth perpetuated by the programmers of society . It's literally the opposite . It's totally in men's selfish best interest to be ' pro-choice ' . Think about it .

@politimac720 @Squirrel_City_ @Woofaraw @CChiffley @LeahNTorres I'd allow abortion any time a doctor and patient agreed it was the best course for the patient . I know what you're implying and no one just wakes up at nine months pregnant deciding they want an abortion . At nine months , ending a viable pregnancy happens via birth .
@Matt24326055 @CNN Have been my whole life and , gasp , I am pro-child and pro-choice . I do not force my beliefs down the throats of others .

@enochUSMCHongKg @BrandonStraka @pokipseeman @RevChuckCurrie If you're asking me why men who rape babies are opposed to abortion rights , I think the answer is pretty obvious , fascist .
@JustPhilD @EPoe187 I guess ... Again , I don't know many pro-choice people who care if " viability " is at 24 weeks or 20 weeks . If a woman has an abortion at 30 weeks I'll assume she has good reason and mind my business . But maybe that tech point can move the margins of pro-choicers .
@colin_car @Ellenarlenemich @dtannie @realDonaldTrump Agreed . They are dividing our country and pissing a lot of Americans off ... who would have otherwise been happy .. causing the love of many to grow cold .. just like the Bible foretold ... Democrats are doing it .

@ZemanLynnZ @RandPaul I'm sure you do ... until they start blowing whistles on things like Planned Parenthood selling baby parts , then SUDDENLY we need to know their identities , political affiliation , and if they have ulterior motives . Pity you can't hold those you like to that same standard ...

Gulf Coast High School recognizes 78 different clubs on campus , many of which are political , but refuses to allow the pro-life Sharks 4 Life club on the grounds that it would be too political or controversial .

I ’ m impressed by the dedication of the women , like Nikki Bruni , who regularly stand in front of this Planned Parenthood facility and offer counsel to women who are planning on aborting children . They save lives .

@jaspscherer @SylvesterTurner @RepSylviaGarcia Yes I do know what happens . Lowest unemployment rates in history . Elimination of unnecessary , business stifling regulations , constitutional abiding judges , attempt to stop the govt funded abortion machine , elimination of the ObamaCare mandate . All good stuff
When the topic of abortion comes up , men might think : Abortion is horrible ; women should not have abortions . And never once consider the man who CAUSED the unwanted pregnancy . If you ’ re not holding men responsible for unwanted pregnancies , then you are wasting your time .

@billmaher Here's some recommended reading for you , Bill . Your choice to provide a platform for anti-vaxxers is quite disappointing . The only thing it shows is that YOU don't know shit . Educate yourself .
Elected leaders need to listen to their constituents . Banning access to safe , legal abortion is not what people want . That's why @OversightDems are holding a hearing to examine state efforts to undermine access to abortion . Constituents want more access to health care , not less .
@MitchFletcher4 @EvanAKilgore After they have the child so they can actually care for it . Better maternal care while pregnant as the US has one of the highest maternal mortality rates . I am worried about fixing all this before worrying about another woman ’ s body . Abortion is not BC I do not -

This one is pretty good . Really . So good that twitter jumped my feed to a Planned Parenthood ad as soon as I tried to retweet it . Had to go back to find it .
@jfinamo @TruthAgape @justinthefair @Sam_DeLoach @TrumpStudents In the Roe decision , the court employed what ’ s called a “ balancing test , ” one which said that a woman ’ s right to an abortion must be balanced against the government ’ s interests in protecting maternal and prenatal life .
The state of Missouri has refused to track such things as opioid prescriptions and gun ownership because of “ invasion of privacy concerns ” ( or so they say ) . But when the subject involves women and their bodies , privacy issues fall by the wayside .
LIFENEWS reports : Activists Sue to Overturn Every Pro-Life Law in Minnesota , Would Allow Abortions Up to Birth
@mojolikesart Proof ? Because women weren't mass slaughtering their children before abortion was legal , and abortion is legal through all 9 months here and women still murder their born babies instead of aborting .

@Big2thaE @Firstmate1060 @IlhanMN The fact that you equate billionaires as a reference to Jews is anti-semitic . Her previous statement was a poor choice of words ( which she apologized for ) , but her obvious intent was to say that groups that give money to legislators often get what they pay for .
@DailyCaller They benefited from an Obama judge would allowed redistricting that harmed Republicans . Kathy Tran , who is the face of 40 week abortion got re-elected . Let that sink in folks .
@Hazel_ok @LeahNiD @artimusfoul @Rubberbandits @JessCaitReid For years , dozens on the Left ran with GO'D despite the fact she was always right-wing ; not to mention the love-ins with anti-choice socialists such as Terry McM and John Connors . Fascism is under no threat from a handful of politically impotent tweeps running a blacklist .
@PrisonPlanet And that's exactly what they do . Satanic rituals . Blood sacrifices and adrenochrome . They think it keeps them young . Celebrities very much into it , why do you think they love planned Parenthood so much and hate Trump . Trump's exposing them .
@a_dark_knight @vixmcintyre @LilaGraceRose Seeing that an abortion ends a pregnancy . There is no child for which to pay child support . You wouldn ’ t be “ opting ” out of anything .
@PattyandSox @notlivbrown @fight4women @Leo97894180 @sbmedia78 @DaphGillentine @KitaSethi @Joshua4Congress That ’ s awfully cavalier for someone who is advocating for such “ bad stuff ” to be maximized for women who are pregnant against their wishes . And neglects that one means of moving forward may be to have an abortion 🤷 ‍ ♀ ️

I do sometimes wonder in which country's ( constitution ? ? ) did our leaders swear to safeguard & protect rifting the Bible or Quran before God & Kenyans ? We all agreed to guarantee right of picketing , freedom of speech , assembly , right to life , marriage btwn man & woman ?
@MattWalshBlog Coincidentally , it ’ s exactly the same number of people who have ever gotten an abortion “ moments from birth . ”
Far better to focus on who " we " are than who " they " are . I'm convince " we " have the better case , if we have the patience to commit to " our " message , not " theirs . " I prefer to play on my home field . Abortion is an " away game " in MS at this moment . Let's be real about that .
@robin_paley @toddempcke @keitheyoung @erichovind You need to get it through your head ... Abortion is NOT a medical matter or a " private " affair . Abortion is MURDER and a very PUBLIC concern . I don't care one iota about your " private " medical affairs .
