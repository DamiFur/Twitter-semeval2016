@maryycruz_ @TSAcidZz @peytnhaag @saltysam01 Yes , and you got lucky . Your birth mother had the choice to give birth to you and put you up for adoption . Whoever adopted you had a choice to do so . Just like women who have an abortion have that choice .

@moshik_temkin Making the point that these are the electoral issues that should be highlighted - as well as abortion to ensure millennial and young adult turnout . Health care debate should focus on continued attempts to repeal ACA , not on M4A .
This argument without specifics is just mental masturbation . If Yglesias wants to discuss this honestly there ‚Äô s an election next Tuesday that highlights the point - John Bel Edwards is anti choice . Is Yglesias arguing that Democrats should abandon being pro choice ?
Critics are concerned this is a backdoor way to limit access to services like abortion , but Dan Williams says that's " absolutely not " true . Instead , he says this is about the ‚Äú moral distress " of doctors forced to do things contrary to their beliefs . ableg

@Jaye_218 @jerseycornelia @PPFA Nice strawman argument . I know of no one who argues that abortion does not end a pregnancy . The question is whether or not that is an ethical or moral act . Zero abortions are performed when the baby is 6 lbs if the baby is viable . It is called induction of labor or C / S .
@BlarbyB @ewarren That's not true . It depends on how far along you are in gestation , and in some cases abortion can also save the life of the mother when both lives are at risk due to abnormalities .

@BellonaRevived Seriously , I mean this as politely as possible , but saying " All the Pro Life people are either ; Gen X , Baby boomers , or Heterosexual " ? That's pretty ignorant ..

@davidakin I thought religion & politics weren ‚Äô t to mix . Have the other leaders stated their personal views ? Personally I don ‚Äô t give a rats ass what those r .

@Denlewis01 These guy are for abortion because they jealous of real women who actually have a baby
Because feminists have convinced women it's a life sentence in jail and strips you of your dreams and individuality and have influenced society to reinforce this against us . It's SICK .
Men don't die when they're denied a safe abortion . Men don't die during childbirth . Men don't lose scholarships or job opportunities for getting pregnant . Either way , the woman carries the greater risk , the woman should have the final say .
It tells us that pro-life is a losing issue in these suburban areas and Trump should avoid it like the plague ( even though I am personally pro-life ) winning has to be the main goal .

As opposed to you monsters who slaughter innocent children for convenience . And BTW ... I donate a lot of money to needy children . And I ‚Äô m not even pro life , I ‚Äô m anti-abortion . Far too many of you monsters need to die for me to be pro-life .

@MisterCorduroy @cwwhite212 But if you don ‚Äô t start with abortion everything else falls away . You can ‚Äô t have any justice without justice in the womb . And that ‚Äô s why it ‚Äô s the preeminent issue .

Abortion is a the descision of the one carrying the baby . If a woman doesn't want to edi wag pilitin . If you think it's a sin then that's your opinion but you have no right to shame those who decides to undergo it . Kung sino yung may katawan sya yung masusunod .

How would a baby or an abortion change the appearance of your vagina . Are you bitches ok !
What is this gripe you gave with single mothers ? Women are left to raise children on their own all the time in a multitude of ways . Who cares ? All that matters is the child is taken care of and doesn ‚Äô t end up brainless , judgmental , and annoying . Your parents failed at that part .

That ‚Äô s exactly right . And that ‚Äô s why we need intervention from the federal level of government and the new Minister of Health for Canada üá® üá¶ must take action to prevent this from happening again , and to force New Brunswick to open a new abortion clinic !
@PattyandSox @sbmedia78 @DaphGillentine @notlivbrown @KitaSethi @Joshua4Congress There is nothing pro-life about a movement that wants to ban safe legal abortion because with abortion bans comes unsafe illegal abortions that kill and injure women . That ‚Äô s not pro life . 60 % of women favor legal abortion . Pro choice men respect a woman to maker her own choices .

@XplosiveTweets They skip over birth control to already pregnant like it's irrelevant . Suggest two forms of bc or God forbid , temporary abstinence , they get rabid and hide behind 4-5 % of rape / abuse / health crisis scenarios . It's üíØ % about sex . Most abortion is insurance for irresponsibility .
@dlongenecker1 The important question is this , if a Catholic supports a politician who follows most of Catholic positions but is pro-choice , does that person deny himself access to the Source and Summit of Christian life as well ?
@notaxation Didn't notice the pro-life thing till now but I definitely noticed several other pro-conservative ideas . Not surprising though because Japan hasn't gone " woke " yet . lol

@hollandcourtney I want to say that as someone who is pro-choice , this sickens me . It is totally abhorrent . This is something only a depraved serial killer would do . Please do not be fooled into thinking all pro-choice people are like this .

@tsmith_m @SierraTalks44 @MadamS8N I personally believe " on demand " abortion should be safe legal without restriction and accessible up untill viability unless a threat to the mothers safety / health or a diagnosis in the fetus precludes it from meaningfully survival after birth .

@prochoiceforal1 @dannyt0m If this was such a big deal , why use a 40 - year-old case ? Where are all these women dying because prolife ? Chemo while pregnant is now basically risk free , especially at 25 weeks , which makes this case a moot point anyway .

April 10 , 2015 In the USA we have aborted 363,222 babies so far this year . Pro Life Pray To End Abortion
@Jayne1115 @AboveNun @lmsespeaks @Legally_De @EquityForward Planned Parenthood does amazing work for women and men . They provide exams , birth control , education , testing , and referrals to low or no cost prenatal care .
Catherine Miranda is a dangerous threat to abortion rights . She co-sponsored a bill to limit health insurance coverage for abortions , voted for the 20 - week ban , and voted to defund Planned Parenthood . Arizona doesn't need her regressive views in the Legislature . thankunext
Many people have gone through life threatening situations to murder another person . That's not a persuasive argument for abortion . The anti-baby-killing prolife crowd know abortions are dangerous , it's another reason we are against them . Our side isn't confused .
@Janemarch888 @JoshTheGinger94 @bam97701yahoo1 @LeahNTorres @CChiffley Yes , comparing abortion to slave owning is a dumb argument . And I believe that would depend on the medical situation . If they ‚Äô re far enough along that viability is possible and there ‚Äô s time to induce labor and deliver live , it ‚Äô s my understanding they ‚Äô d do that .

@UmbraWulf @bunnysay_ot i havent even watched that video cus i rly dont care what that publication thinks , however that doesnt mean that manspreading isnt a thing you should never care about because its not as big as abortion law , and it sure isnt an indicator no one cares about bigger issues

@jbsllvn @I_am_Steele @ItsStormmy @RothsteinAbe @realDonaldTrump Yeah , trying to take away people's Medicaid / Medicare , invading womens rights with restrictive abortion bills , acting thuggish and getting in verbal fights with private citizens tends to make a politician unpopular .
@StefMNicholas I used to follow a pro-life feminist group , then I realized there was no backbone and a lot was accepted from these women , they were technically just against abortion . But they saw a lot of things that lead to abortion as acceptable .
Preventing a baby from being born isn ‚Äô t abortion . Abortion IS forced birth . The mother is forced to give birth to the dead child . When a woman is pregnant , a baby will come out eventually no matter what . I ‚Äô m sorry this upsets you . Pro Choice Apologetics

August 29 , 2019 Poll : Growing Majority of Americans Support Legal Abortion
@Anni_Bruno @jerbergmann @Leo97894180 @NARAL @NARALVirginia How aware are you ? Are the 35 % of Women who want abortion restricted to reasons of health and life , the 50 % who consider themselves " pro-life " , the 65 % who favor increased restrictions and the majority of women who find abortion for any reason " morally objectionable " , anti-women ?
@baimcpher @BeeAmellia Bottom line is if you don ‚Äô t want an abortion , don ‚Äô t get one . What another woman does with her life is absolutely none of your business . Funny how people like you are all for ‚Äú saving lives ‚Äù but dont care about the 400,000 children in foster care or the kids who have shitty parents

@prochoiceforal1 @letat_lechat @ReproRights Abortion helps to cover up the abuse I mentioned , though . Get it out into the light , not allow abortion to be used to cover it up .

@aquinasbear @americamag @MikeOLoughlin You are so full of BS ! Being pro-life is much more than being against abortion period ! IF Traditionalists care about being pro-life you would care about all life but you only care about the children in the womb but once they are born you could care less about them .
@dlcama @SherakMartin Oh they fell on many levels . If they wanted to reduce the rates of abortion , all they need to do is give a proper sex education to the students and make birth-control easy to access . But on vaccinations , they deserve credit .

@Alyssa_Milano I think Steve Bannon and drain the swamp kick started this and they all came out of the woodwork . Drain the swamp is a reference to a biblical story where Jezebel was defeated . They called Obama & Hillary Jezebel for abortion and LGBT protection not good times in the US today

@baimcpher Seeing as most clinics force a woman to watch an ultrasound before going through with an abortion and abortion is still a very common practice despite that inhumanity , I would disagree with your point .
Would you have stood by whilst Nazis systematically killed 6 million innocent people ? Do you stand by funding Planned Parenthood to kill and then harvest and sell baby parts and also to donate millions to the Democrats ?

@tranganhdong @tatumblinn Literally , why would you just randomly hit someone up and say , ‚Äú hey , this sad thing you posted about ... cool ... but abortion is murder ! ‚Äù ? ? I don ‚Äô t get it . That highlight had nothing to do with abortion ...
This is undoubtedly the dumbest , not to mention , heartless and dare I say most dangerous not - so - Pro Choice come back . Don ‚Äô t like littering , don ‚Äô t litter . Don ‚Äô t like racism , don ‚Äô t be a racist . Don ‚Äô t like taking the life of innocent people , don ‚Äô t murder , abort or euthanize .
@DrMichaelLBrown @POTUS This argument would work if so called evangelicals would have called trump.out when he caged children , took healthcare away from millions , etc . Instead all I have seen is evangelicals use abortion to justify anything that Trump does . They are like the 21 century pharasees
@DanaKyleMusic Do you believe that HRC or Warren haven't endorsed anti-choice candidates or voted anti-choice in political office ? Or is it your position that only Bernie is to be held accountable for this ?
@nicolergalloway The endorsement follows historic wins for reproductive rights locally & nationally , including special Mo Leg elections in where pro-reproductive health candidates won 5/6 x seats , & in Virginia where these candidates flipped both legislative chambers .

Is this where the Church is heading by ordaining women ? Who are the women who will be lining up the be ordained ? üëá üèª
I really cannot comprehend how people can call themselves ‚Äú pro-life ‚Äù and advocates for the ‚Äú sancticity of human life ‚Äù while also actively working to defund healthcare programs , take away Medicaid and social services , and dismantle public education .
High School Denies Student ‚Äô s Request to Start Pro-Life Club , But Allows Animal Rights Group . Now that's a problem !
@thetomwilcox @INTJ_Joe @nicolet0407 " Baby " requires birth . But asking asshole questions to make it seem like something else is an asshole thing to do . Abortion is terminating a pregnancy , not " killing babies . " Stop being an asshole .
Yet another reason I ‚Äô m basically in the verge of being pro-life . I ‚Äô ve been pro-choice for years but I find it to be an increasingly indefensible position every day .
@spookymols @coffeemama91 Why do you think so many countries have abortion restrictions ? Why do you think it has been frowned upon for so long in so many societies ? If what pro-life advocates say is true and the human inside the woman is in fact human , how is it not murder ?

@Sam_DeLoach @Wife_Then_Mama I find it hypocritical that if a driver hits a pregnant woman and killed her and the child they are charged with the death of 2 people . If a woman has an abortion , they say an unborn child isn ‚Äô t considered a life . Hypocrisy at its finest .

Repeat Sodom ...
@ZubyMusic It shouldn ‚Äô t be a left / right issue . Both sides get stuck in group think and few leaders are willing to put themselves in the middle ground . Abortion should be a limited and last resort option , after 16-20 weeks should be completely outlawed . Easy to have sex , not get pregnant

Please read this thread . The ban on political ads does make pro-choice activism harder , so lend a hand if you can .
@MadamS8N @nord_allen @prochoiceforal1 @EileenKunstman Being prolife doesn ‚Äô t automatically equal to the belief of traditional gender roles . There ‚Äô s even a whole Secular pro life movement .

The net result of " prolife " MAGAs sneering that a living wage is the opposite of " caring about the unborn " is death . Pitting the unborn against the rest of the Church's teaching is a sucker play designed to make conservative cheer for cruelty as " prolife "
@HarmonyJacobso4 @Carlspad @GabrielleCymone We'll see . Some people are alarmed at the changing of norms and mores that have steadied our country through tough times .

To trust their leadership and wisdom about what is next and what they see on the ground in their local communities as the foundation of the roadmap forward . It ‚Äô s a call for fully funded and staffed abortion funds with every resource they need to shape narratives and actual access

@PPFA We can turn old planned parenthood buildings into office buildings and rent them out at a profit .
A federal judge has blocked an HHS policy that would ‚Äô ve protected the First Amendment rights of health-care workers with moral or religious objections to abortion . The decision will allow providers to coerce employees into violating their consciences .
Is it just us or is Oklahoma having a moment lately ? Watchmen pilot , Broadway revival , this news !
Protecting access to abortion is not just fight for our rights and laws ‚Äì it ‚Äô s an act of love . For our partners , our families , our friends ‚Äì ourselves .

@KamiSawZe @nes_nathan @xan_desanctis Which is why abortion should remain legal so women don ‚Äô t have to risk their lives having back-alley abortions .
In conclusion with an ongoing issue of abortion , in the end isn't it all Pro-Choice ? Don't we all CHOOSE which side we stand on ?
@haysquirt @KatelynTweeter For 1 . A fetus is a human being . No matter how science defines it . God says . ‚Äò Before i formed you in the womb , i knew you . ‚Äô So anyone who has an abortion . Whether its 1 day or 9 month fetus . Its a human being to God , and he will judge us all according to our choices . good & bad .
@darbyTL If Scheer's Jesus Brigade was REALLY ' pro-life ' the mother's life - the person who actually has been born - would take precedence over a 8 - 11 week fetus ( when most abortion occurs ) the fetus , which is just that - a fetus - and not a ' person ' or a ' baby . Fundies are pro-stupid .
