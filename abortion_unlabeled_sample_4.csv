@NitramNosirrag I think this growing celebration of abortion at any time is one of the natural ends of abortion itself : if a woman has a right to bodily autonomy than it doesn ‚Äô t matter at what stage of the pregnancy she ‚Äô s in . People are being honest about where the logic leads .

@ALReproRightsAd @prochoiceforal1 @SexxxtinaAqua @wrightdjohn @_alex_joshua History is irrelevant in this conversation .

@SoulsandSundaes @vbgame143 @HuffPost That ‚Äô s the root of the problem . Extreme protectiveness is taken with women because men are not held responsible for their actions .

I will add that there * are * folks who do argue abortion as not only a legal necessity , but a moral public good . Some of those folks are friends of mine . I think that ‚Äô s a different argument than a pragmatic pro-choice view that says abortion is wrong but making it illegal is bad .

@wadegautreau @charliekirk11 You are aware Planned Parenthood is funded over $ 500M . So this $ 45M is less then 10 % of what they do with their funds . Most funds go to help women who can ‚Äô t get proper care . Less then 10 % is for abortions as well .

@Tosiebear @blueskies366 @shaniafernand99 @FakeClinicsCdn I've had an abortion . You know what they offered me at the clinic ? Options . Resources . Information . If I had chosen to continue the pregnancy , they offered referrals to prenatal care . They offered counselling . They followed up . Pro-choice clinics are , shockingly , pro-choice .
On top of that Virginia was fine with their blackface democrat governor who endorsed killing a live birth baby if it was born during an abortion . People going crazy over Virginia makes no sense .
Abortion is NOT freedom . Anyway , the devil never comes with his ugly face . He always comes in disguise . Support for abortion and being Catholic are mutually exclusive .
I just took action with @theactionnet : Demand ‚Äò Pro-Life ‚Äô Leaders Disavow Criminalization of Abortion . Take action here : Please do it too !

@shimkardashian Hate this I just checked like 4 boxes at planned parenthood
@SteveJoffe @schuklenk My take is that eugenics and reproductive bioethics - specifically debates surrounding abortion and contraception - were leading topics in early days of bioethics as were others you mention . Not either or .
@redusa21 You support Donald Trump don't you . The guy who is caging babies like they don't matter . But tell us how you're " pro-life " again .
@Bullittv8 @BigRiverSalmon I agree that the foster care system needs MAJOR reform and that sex trafficking & abuse is evil . But that isn ‚Äô t related to abortion . That ‚Äô s my whole point .

@robertshrimsley I'm really sorry you've written that , Robert . I don't think it's fair . Neither of us would want this but some face the choice of an islamaphobe with tendencies towards fascism or an anti-semite . My tweets " shrug " at neither and I'm sure yours wouldn't either .

Keep hearing from people saying feminism is a force for good . But they don't refute any of this . They pretend there's absolutely no reason feminism is currently known for such things and imagine a woman in her 30s in a leftist-dominated field has never once encountered a feminist

@NotableDesister The only way to end the myth is to ban trying to reproduce as the other sex . As long as the law promotes the myth that same-sex couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples , it will also have to promote the myth males have the same reproductive rights as females .

Anyone claiming to be a Christian but is OK with abortion is more than misguided . They ‚Äô ve already sold their soul to the devil . That ‚Äô s about as plain as I can put it . Abortion is painfully butchering tiny , innocent , defenseless babies . What could possibly be Christian about that ?

@WestPoint06mom @deannadaughtery @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @thehill I dont believe in abortion . I chose adoption when I was a young woman . But I dont shove my beliefs down others throats .

@NJ_Lindquist Women have abortions because Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry / PR machine is been lying to them . First they were told " is not a baby " , then " is not human " , " it doesn't look like a baby " . ( 1 )
@LifeNewsHQ I want to see if we can find the figure of how much planned parenthood actually makes fully with all kick backs for each abortion and see if can make it so adoption agencies can beat those figures .. Let's bring the money to support life ..
@XplosiveTweets There is no such thing as " pro choice . " You're either a genocidal freak who supports the existence of abortion , or you're a real person and you don't

@pro_real_life On the contrary , the only one actually giving due consideration to the consent and choices the mother made leading to the dependence of the child is pro-life advocates . When pro-choice advocates so completely disregard the choices women have made , they devalue their autonomy .
If a man thinks it's his right to decide on abortion , to decide if women deserve privacy from voyeurism , Men-free toilets , prison , shelters , sports , Is that a zero sum game for Women ?

WE AREN'T DONE YET , PEEPS ! The State that kicked off the most restrictive abortion ban race of 2018/2019 needs our attention . LOUISIANA is holding it's elections on Nov 16th . All seats in the State Senate are up & 24 in the State House . Vote Blue One Voice1 wtp2020TKA
@VickiMcKenna @ScottWalker @EmpowerWi @MacIverWisc Your bio says you are pro-life , yet you celebrate the denial of life-saving funds to people because it saves a few bucks .
@JanineMaverick Of course there are two lives to support - the mother & the child both . That ‚Äô s why prolife organizations offer support & help for both . The only thing we are against is mothers electively killing their children .
@ByFisted @Shaz1054 @Vermeullarmine Not as bad as abortion ‚Äî but I think the ( admittedly unconfirmed , but plausible ) videos / reports of Bolivian police using arbitrary violence against indigenous civilians is analogous !
@JenAshleyWright Then why do you vote for people who have led to the abortion of millions ? Honey , you need to look in the mirror because you are a royal hypocrite and delusional .
@72968 @NRA @JohnTiegen Who is ? Leftists who don't believe in individual choice . No choice in firearms , education , health care , union involvement , etc . Pro-choice my ass .

@RichBbrookie @coffeemama91 @baimcpher A fetus is a human being , and abortion kills that human being .
Soros , he has changed tactics . Going after state and local elections . Follow the money .

@NUPEsupreme I agree with you . If you read the thread I was responding to , it was to someone who voted for Trump and regretted it . I know lots of decent people who voted for Trump for that Supreme Court seat , because they are pro-life or worried about religious liberty .
Interesting article : Cardiff University Students Union has a new pro-life society which has plans to stand outside abortion clinics and try to persuade women not to enter . Students ' Union spokesperson defends this under principles of freedom of speech
@that1mum She's just trying to make her point and refusing to acknowledge anyone that opposes it . Notice that she won't reply to any of the moms who say they're pro choice . She only replies to the women with no children as if pregnancy is going to brainwash them into being pro life .
An Obituary of the Western World based on lies , sexual perversion , murders , and abortion to term is a society in DECAY .
The Salvation Army uses donations to lobby against LGBTQ rights and women's reproductive Rights and health care access . I feel like I've known that for a long time . Donate to the North Texas Food Bank instead y'all !
Those of you prolife advocates . You want to explain to me how you are ok with this ? Medicare For All Bernie Sanders2020
@Doodisgirl Pro Life üå∏
@charliekirk11 Totally disturbing and undefensible . Don ‚Äô t let one man ‚Äô s sick act categorize pro-choice advocates . I ‚Äô ve only seen this clip retweeted by right wing pundits ü§î
How many babies have been murdered in the name of abortion ASSHOLE ! ! !
