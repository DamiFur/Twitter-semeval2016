Abortion is just one of those extremely personal things , I'm pro-choice in that I believe if a woman wants to have 19 kids or 19 abortions , that's on her . She will feel the consequences of that . But I can never say do ___ with your body , it ain't mine .

Is there a way I can intentionally look at porn and it not be sinful ? Is there a way I can intentionally murder someone and it not be a sin ? How can a " Christian " vote for an abortion supporting Democrat and it NOT be sinful ?
Thank God you don't because that's crazy logic . An innocent baby vs convicted murderers and rapists.the Death Penalty is just for many guilty . Lemme guess u don't think women who get abortions are murderers either ? That's y all the cool kids are abolitionist pro lifers are weak .
@MizzMaryKhalaf Hello Mary . I do understand your concern.While Democrats support choice , they aren't pro-abortion . Choice itself means different things to different people . Just as some believe choice conflicts with religion , others believe pro-life conflicts with their beliefs as well .
@marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump Republicans are prolife but they sure hate the elderly cause they're constantly taking away from them . Wanting the social security they paid into to start being labeled as welfare . The entire party makes me sick . Yea pro life all right

@realjimrussell does this " sensible population growth and management " have anything to do with promoting abortion ? because the killing via abortion of 1.5 billion humans since 1980 worldwide alone constitutes the largest mass killing to date in all of human history .

@psychdr100 @intelligencer I think this is a very sensitive issue that should not be determined by political parties . I myself would never abort a baby but needs to be understood why some woman choose . I don't like to hear about abortion post heartbeat or late term.But others have reason
@Jaxgma3235 @GeraltofPDX @4YrsToday Wrong . Abortion is taking away a baby's right to life , not supporting gay marriage is more of a religious thing and the GOP over doesn't care so long as you don't do it in their churches , and Islam is incompatible with Western values so it can go back desert it came from .

Serious question - if the market for a Catholic-leaning , economically left , socially right party is as large as the First Things crowd would have us believe , why don't they form it ?
Self managed abortion has a lot of benefits , particularly for those without access to in-person care . It ‚Äô s also important to remember that medication abortion , which self managed abortion is referring to , is incredibly safe .

@Jessica72193295 Cries over abortion , doesnt care about the well being of anyone once theyre born . Typical !
@PaulaChertok @Acyn It should be noted that the Democrat Party line on abortion and socialism was DRASTICALLY different just 8 years ago than now , and Biden is proof that it ‚Äô s a race to the left for potential candidates . @TulsiGabbard is the only candidate that isn ‚Äô t extreme and she ‚Äô s polling 3 %

@fleur_de_lis_ @PatrickAlanKel2 @Samm1972 @Jakepoop13 @CaptainLombard3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I can tell you that I'm not in any way better off now than I was 3 years ago . Moreover , I'm not all about my personal pocketbook and bottom line . I happen to care about such silly things as pollution , kids in cages , erosion of reproductive rights , etc . You now , the liberal stuff
Another thing ... Pro-life . If Pro-Lifers are really Pro-Lifers then they would have cared about humans after they were born NOT during pregnancy . Thank goodness I am Pro-choice and respect every woman's right to have a child . Poor choice of Words from the right .

So how common is self-managed abortion in the US ? Here ‚Äô s my new piece co-authored with @1MegDonovan on @Health_Affairs Blog .
@DennisEricson False dear . Forced pregnancy is rape , and taking away an option to abortion . Rapist also use pregnancy as a form of reproductive abuse , by trying to ban abortion up you support reproductive abusers . That ‚Äô s not choice dear
Helpful context from sociologist @TriciaCBruce in @jackmjenkins ' piece on denying Communion , politics , and abortion .
@JaxForLife Quick thing , the beginning clip I believe is called a D & X , or an intact dilation and extraction . It ‚Äô s usually used to extract a miscarried fetus in the second trimester of a pregnancy . Very rarely an abortion , unless there ‚Äô s a severe issue with the pregnancy .
I could hardly get through reading this . Keep this in mind the next time someone in Hollywood calls for a boycott because of a pro-life policy while bending over to please China ‚Äô s government censure boards .

@smokntoes @LewisForMN No , it doesn't . Coincidentally when people have access to birth control and sex education , the people forced into those choices are fewer . If only those options weren't also in danger of being taken away by the anti-choice movement .

@Rewire_News After the Dem Debate in Ohio , the former President of Planned Parenthood said abortion should be " safe , legal , and rare . " It's hard to criticize people in our own movement when we're always under attack from our enemies , but someone had to do it .

Let me make this clear , no ' rule ' is above the constitution . The right to abortions are including under our American Freedoms . Which makes all abortion bans unconstitutional . Again , for the red hats in the back : All abortion bans are unconstitutional .
my normally quiet menchies are full of 1 ) awful abortion-related experiences & 2 ) terrible things we do to trans kids . but sure , it's the " radical left " that's the problem
@BishopStika @KenHomanSJ This logic seems to imply that the unborn are not ( already ) alive in the womb . It indicates pro-birtherism more than it does pro-life
Planned Parenthood performed their last surgical abortion in its Osceola County , Florida location on October 31 . Learn more about the case that lead to this :
@Elizabe79625323 1996 they forced abortion on me after injecting me with no tests The GP was Dr Hague
@a_meluzzi Quindi trovo obbrorioso che in questa sede qualcuno abbia fatto riferimento a questa fake new , costruita per giustificare aborti di massa con annesse selezione eugenetica neonazista ( tramite Planned Parenthood ) e guerre di sterminio gi√† pianificate da tempo .

3 . The ruling and opposition parties at the time cooperated to speedily legalize abortion for the purpose of relieving victims of the crime . WW2

@EricScheidler @LeahNTorres Yes , we will . Everybody knows what an abortion is - you've got no news flash there . All we need to do is teach people basic biology & facts , and then you are left screaming to nobody .
@SlenderSkeptic Semantics can't prevent us from recognizing that just as Roundup kills living weeds , abortions kill the living unborn . My pro-life peers choose not to defend their stance with semantics ; they confront and accept the reality .

Federal Judge Voids ' Conscience Rule ' on Abortion for Health Care Workers
@MarieFrRenaud @DanDWill @jkenney Enough with the euphemisms ! The right to choose what ? Say what you mean if your conscious is clear . It's the right to choose to kill an infant in the womb . Future generation will look back on abortion as we do slavery , and on that day you will be among the villains of history .
@TmaddArt @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump It ‚Äô s interesting because the most pro-life frequently oppose the programs which are most effective in preventing abortion . I can see it ‚Äô s a competition of principles . But which one is most important to you ?
@debrarodmanva propped up the abortion up until birth bill of Trans . She was a lazy delegate . Her 1 bill to @Dunnavant4VA having 55 of hers signed by democrat governors . 26 of the Dr . ‚Äô s bills were healthcare related . desperatedebra constantly lied abt her & called her a quack
@STUinSD offers compelling evidence of moral erosion by left ; not on list : - paid abortion up to birth - forcing docs to perf abortion - secure borders 4 Syria not US - unsustainable benefits to illegal immigrants in exch for votes - lying @ climate , gender & health care 4 votes
@dbaria Man the problem with the Democrats is if you don ‚Äô t support and I will go so far as to say advocate for abortion and ALL other liberal policies you don ‚Äô t belong . THAT is why conservatives refuse to vote for Democrats .
I ‚Äô m just gonna say to pro-life folks : adoption isn ‚Äô t the solution to not wanting to keep the baby . WOMEN ARE NOT BABY FACTORIES FOR COUPLES WHO CANT CONCEIVE . They shouldn ‚Äô t HAVE to give birth for the sake of anyone else ‚Äô s needs but theirs . There , I said it .

@POTUS
University pro-life society helps support pregnant students by raising money for Alma Mater Fund :
" ... Without an electoral consequence , Governor Parson will accelerate his extreme anti-choice agenda , including making Missouri the only state without a provider where a woman can access her constitutional right to choose since Roe v . Wade was decided in 1973 . "
That's a hybrid . A hymen is a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion e . g someone claiming to be ' pro-life ' but not giving a flying fuck about anyone who isn't a foetus .
THIS , and I can't stress this e enough , IS AMERICA :

@CandieIsTheName Yes ! ! I really don ‚Äô t think they realize how hurtful and harmful those accusations can be . Even if a woman did have an abortion at some point does that now mean she never deserves to experience motherhood when she is ready ? It ‚Äô s just horrible . It ‚Äô s women attacking women .

@AlexxysAmore @vixmcintyre A woman at any time can walk away from a date A woman at any time can stop the sexual advances of a man A woman at any time can stop during sex So after having had sex she is under no obligation to turn your sperm into a baby Its a CHOICE that only she gets to make prochoice

@likephntms4ever @andordean @partygirlu2 But that would require you to have a mentality older than 12 and an intellectual capacity to actually understand what research is . Usually , if someone older has a baby it is very much wanted and abortion would never be a choice they would make . Can't leave ignorance so staying !
Quick question . If it ‚Äô s the women ‚Äô s choice and gets an abortion then it ‚Äô s ok . Now if the father of the child doesn ‚Äô t want the baby can he petition the court ‚Äò s to make the woman have an abortion because he cannot afford a child support or plan Ole doesn ‚Äô t want a child ?

@jasonebeling As my tweet says , I am pro-life . Certainly Biden can be wrong . Certainly America ‚Äô s abortion laws can be wrong . But that doesn ‚Äô t make every person morally complicit in promoting abortion , even if we think their logic is faulty . That ‚Äô s silly .

@nextwavefutures Hmm . I remember a Labour MP talking about the " aggregate moral wisdom " of parliament . The complexity around abortion was in reconciling ethcial differences rather than practical ones , surely ? Beleifs rather than interests ?

@florbosagbag Because conservatism is progressivism driving the speed limit . Both ideologies have extremes flaws , but being anti-LGBT is political suicide now because Western societies have agreed to not practice discrimination anymore . Conservatives have no choice but to accept that too .

@MichelleRempel @nspector4 @_scottreid @reicurran It is absolutely fair to ask a person running for office about what they believe . Ie do you support SSM .

@FergusFSU @wamba138 @StefMNicholas @CatholicMe And even if they repent To repent of such grave sin that is abortion you need to ask a Bishop for that the average priest cannot do it And secondly , even after they repent , they will still pass a long time in purgatory for such a grave sin that is kinslaying and child murder

@realDonaldTrump you need a lesson in pregnancy stillborn & miscarriages read this b4 u bad mouth women who have sadly lost a baby i am very passionate about this .. If a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks , it is known as a miscarriage . after that it's a stillborn no abortion ! ! !
@Maxxflyy @shivownz @PamperedNegress @thenation @andraydomise Abortion is not a form of birth control . But it's nice to have it as a worst case scenario option ( Birth control failed and you can't raise the child )
We ‚Äô re in Handmaid ‚Äô s Tale territory ... but anyone paying attention knows that already .
@christianllamar @Lrihendry I am still completely confused by the name " Planned Parenthood " there's NO Parenthood , it's planned abortion , that's all it is , @PPFA should change their name , it's fraudulent ! ! @realDonaldTrump
@Stacy_g52 @manny_manatee2 @EileenKunstman @prochoiceforal1 When using contraception , sure . But in reality , when you choose to have sex , you're choosing to commit the very thing we do to reproduce . Therefore both participants are responsible for any results that come from said action . Abortion isnt healthcare , it's murder of innocent kids
My colleagues on the NYT editorial board and I have a new series out on fetal personhood ‚Äî how that notion has been propagated by the anti-abortion movement , lawmakers , and prosecutors , and how it's resulted in women losing rights in a number of ways .
@tperkins @realDonaldTrump Let me translate . He means restricting women's reproductive freedoms and discriminating against the LGBTQ community to make sure they do not have the same rights as hetero couples have . Tony your policies are filled by hate which is why trump will be defeated in 2020 .
Dear @realDonaldTrump @GOP @HouseGOP Until you declare a STATE OF EMERGENCY over the lives of innocent students being massacred and traumatized you lose the right to claim Pro Life . Life outside the womb matters to God too . Students Lives Matter
4 / Those who provide chemical abortion drugs , like Aid Access & Planned Parenthood , downplay the excruciating process that awaits unsuspecting women . Said Elizabeth Gillette about her experience taking Mifeprex , " I had no idea what was coming . No idea . "
@BellonaRevived For arguments sake , may as well just call that an abortion . And no , it pisses me off that you would use miscarriages as your tipping point as I have been a party to one and it is a horrid experience .

That sounds like a pro-life argument .

As I watch episodes of thegrapevinetv George ‚Äô s faces are EVERYTHING I needed . Especially the episode about Pro Life and Pro Choice ! He was taken back .. I loved it . @IamGMJohnson
@papi_chulo1977 @AlexGreenwich Oh you're a wannabe comedian douchebag . Great combo . If you think you have logical facts , you should get a better education . I'm just going to remain happy that my friends , family and myself can access abortion if we choose and Twitter rants from entitled men won't change that .
i was gonna do coca cola or walmart bc they support pro-life people ( people against abortions ) but a lot of other girls in my class are doing that
@AnonnyChick @JSighed @gdsxltrex These are actually reasonable abortion laws to a certain extent
i hate gabys mom everyday for no having an abortion
@Dangchick1 Donald Trump could literally piss on the 2nd amendment , confiscate every gun , and personally perform a late term partial birth abortion on the south lawn and the MAGA bots would still be loyal . the only conviction they truly hold is they want to feel superior to minorities
@hash_tigre @dovevolantsable okay , once more , I * * do not believe bernie is being quiet on being pro-abortion * * . other people do however and i ‚Äô m saying the people who make this argument are just doing it to attack bernie .
I think I read somewhere that only ~ 14 % of Ob / GYNs perform abortions . Will that create a dearth of clinicians in the field ? No one should be forced to participate in the ending of a human life . Also , very interesting that the ones advocating for this are " pro-choice " . ü§î
Lehner claims that there is no way to do an ethical way to do a study on the effects of progesterone after an abortion ... despite the fact that there HAS BEEN ONE & we're waiting on the results ? ? ? Stop The Lies SB155 O Hleg
@1ConservaDog @KevinKtk789 Gosh this is y I am 2000 % against abortion , I will always be pro-life . Newborns are such a blessing . God bless .
@jfinamo @TrumpStudents Your inability to comprehend that abortion isn't not " Murder " and that fetuses aren't children " only shows me that you're qualified to even debate this topic .
@MelissaWhyppe @tariwemadimples So only men disagree with abortion ?
@Melski1 There is no accountability for the abortion industry . Proving once again that abortion is not health care . Also abortion facilities aren't required to be liscensed .

@VP Pro life , you are letting kurd children die and starve , you kidnapped immigrant children at our southern border . Then you abused them in our care . The United Nations sanctioned us . Don't you dare talk about prolife when you do this to children .
Rashmi Desai said : " Sidharth Shukla marta pada rahega to main na pani ka glass side pe rakh k nikalu " Today u have said such a low thing , I understood that news about baby abortion was right . she lost respect , inhumanity üëé May Allah give u a long life Sidharth Shukla BB13
The depravity of the left : left-wing activists hold mock slave auction of Christian pastors to raise money for an organisation which kills unborn children . If anyone else did the same to Muslim imams the same people would display immediate outrage .
@thehill ohhh Stop ! Don't start with the stupid misogynist stuff when you voted for those anti women Republicans for so long . Biden was always trying to protect us women by supporting our reproductive rights , and passing the Violence against women's act .
@sscjusa I love abortion ! It means I can rawdog any slut over a park bench , nut all up inside her walls , never hear from her again and we go on our way . Just a quick casual fuck , insemination and abortion . Nothing really that weird lol
@nbc4i Abortion = Murder
@Mark_virtue @GovGaryJohnson His personal stance was that he supported abortion but his political stance was to follow the tenth amendment and allow states to decide . He wasn't perfect but we will never get perfection . I would happily vote for Gary again . I would not be happy voting for Weld though

@lifelearner47 suddenly the anti-abortion brigade will be enforcing contraception ( on women of course )
