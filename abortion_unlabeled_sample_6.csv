I think Taylor Swift should be in operating room when an abortion is being performed , when the baby is yanked out of the womb piece by piece and dumped in a bucket or perhaps the head goes here , the leg goes there you separate dishes . Once you see that you never go pro-abortion .
@actioncookbook @DrewFrogger I think we ’ re all on the same page here , no worries . I did get out of MJ that he ’ s pro-choice and would run that way and he was extremely matter of fact about it so I am thinking it won ’ t be * as * center right of a campaign as some people fear but honestly WHO THE FUCK KNOWS
Thank you for highlighting that you are pro-choice , @GovernorBullock ! !
@lovstoplay64 @Thund3rOne @JeffDitzler @4st8 We are absolving young girls and women of any personal responsibility and consequences . I ’ m actually pro choice in limited situations but it ’ s gone too far . Abortion is not something to shout from the rooftops or celebrate

@MegGold3 @prochoiceforal1 An excellent question ! I don't feel I've been antagonistic , but they may , likely because someone has hurt them ... I intended only to refute their propaganda . Perhaps someone else can better reach their heart . I sincerely hope that's what happens .

Wow , this IS worse than Gilead . Women have a lot to worry about regarding reproductive rights in parts of this country , but this is horrific .
@DavidJHarrisJr I'm against abortion completely ... however , maybe @ElizabethBanks & @Alyssa_Milano mothers should have considered it !

Why do pro " life " ers always overlook the fact that pregnancy and birth are often lethal for women ? Why do they push views of sexuality that no doctor or therapist have ever endorsed to me ? Why am I supposed to listen to their cherry-picked , bad faith advice ? prolife Pro Choice
@jookmale2003 She is also anti-choice .
@TruthAgape @Lizzy_Lang7 @lifeinthegaps @j_gairns @OzmanShallCome @CriticalCripple @ScrutinyOk It's not a child yet , it's a child in potential . Let's be honest . Literally no one is claiming that abortion would make the trauma disappear , but it might increase it . If a rape victim doesn't want to carry and mother the offspring of her violator she should be given the CHOICE .
@Education4Libs No not even with Clintons OB involved or some royalty or senators CEOs congress people merchants drug companies planned parenthood ... it ’ s all good . No not so much . Integrity and loyalty to God and country or be damned .

@AubreyandGus @leahmcelrath The state that just elected a dem Gov ? Ooo-kay . And I'm gonna assume the only thing you're referring to is abortion ? Yeah , its weird how ' red ' states reacted to ' blue ' states gleefully terminating 3rd tri pregnancies . Couldn't have seen that coming at all .
@charliekirk11 If this is true , it ’ s because their clinics are having trouble staying open . As abortion numbers go down , they need another service to bring in revenue . Prolife generation has been saving mothers and babies and they know that abortion is no longer popular . babiesdeservelove
@sdequus It isn ’ t right to compare abortion to slavery , everyone knows that . But taking an innocent humans life isn ’ t right . I ’ m not a Christian that shoves religion down others throats , but I will stand up for what I believe in and is morally right .
@CathAttic Read the context of that screenshot .
@IvankaTrump Fact : We can finally ratify the ERA because your party lost the VA Leg . Fact : Your dad is accused of raping & sexual assaulting women . Fact : Your administration aims to take away abortion rights & women ’ s access to healthcare . Fact : Your goons rip babies from asylum seeking moms .
I just watched Greys Anatomy give a medically accurate description of what it ’ s like to take the abortion pill ( and yes , they explained that it ’ s two pills . ) It did nothing to advance the plot , but it still made it onto the show . This is progress , folks .

@KnightOfNI5 @Godisgood1836 @blu_feminist @Pro_life_ANCAP @candktoo What is the point of making an account to argue for abortion if you just block the people you're apparently trying to convince ? Or did he never intend to convince us , and just wanted to preach to the choir ...
@JessicaOutLoud @Ethereal_Shaman @emilyslist it would be easily defined - one who believes in the sactity of life throughout the entirety of that life - not just thru a pregnancy and birth ! If someone who claims they are Pro-Life really were that they claim to be they ’ d care how a child was fed & cared for thru - 2

@1CarynH Well , at least we can now clearly see that the Democrats are the real Racists . Lets not forget that they started Planned parenthood with the purpose of aborting black babies . Their hero is racist Margaret Sanger .
@Schlieffen No idea , but here's a time in 2011 where Justin Trudeau noted that , as a Catholic , he is " personally very opposed to abortion " . ( Someone should ask him about it again . )
@emilyslist We're working hard to ban abortion because a boarding humans is murder You can wrap it up in any euphemism you choose , but it doesn't change the fact that you're ending a human life
No one gets an abortion at the state where the fetus is an ACTUAL living being unless medically needed . Abortions are done before that stage . So it ’ s not a child , but a clump of cells . You tried it though . Pro-choice forever bc you know , constitutional rights .

Radical thought : " Abortion rights " should be renamed to " letting women be in charge of their own bodies " . The only thing about reproductive health that should be legislated is access to it .
@Toibin1 @CiaranMcCrink @SiobhanD1234 You did all those things too Peadar for decades .. and when you left it was not because of those issues ... it was to join the alt right fundamentalist anti abortion lobby .. The word hypocrite could spring to mind if one was cynical ..
lemme guess , you want her to get an abortion but she don ’ t want to ?
Altho thers no good sol . preventin the abuse of abortion , the best sol . s go down to bettermnt of sex ed & the availability of artificial contracptives . If more ppl knew bout wht const . s fertility , sex , & reprodction , then abortion and repeated abortion are less likely to occur .
@MaxKennerly @LouisianaGov @mattyglesias Certainly , but I think that a pro-life Dem has a much better chance at winning in places like Louisiana than one who the Republican ’ s could use the cudgel of abortion against .
Liberals love their euphemisms , renaming things , to make them sound better , more acceptable than what they really are . It's like they don't say they're pro-abortion . Calling it pro-choice is vague & sounds reasonable , not like what it is , murder . Pro-Life is accurate , no games .

@LilaGraceRose Abortion is THE issue of humanity . Until there is no abortion we will never be without war . Abortion is THE war on innocence , women , poverty , rape , incest . Mary ’ s fiat is humanity ’ s lesson for all that is good , pure and holy . We need to imitate Our Lady .
@CrazyV_15 Right , not all , but I personally have found most prolife to be more ... invested in trying to change the pro choice people ’ s mind . But it can go both ways for sure !
AMEN & TRUTH MATTERS ! !
Planned Parenthood , facing a Trump rule that restricts referrals for abortions , has withdrawn from Title X funding . Here's how the federal program works and what the org's withdrawal means
As part of flipping the Virginia General Assembly and another victory for prochoice advocates , Democrat Suhas Subramanyam defeated the GOP candidate who suggested ankle bracelets to monitor pregnant women to prevent abortion .
Where as " Right To Life " is a political statement to be banned by the " Free Speech " police , Planned Parenthood would be considered a Woman's Healthcare advertisement . @ffweekend That's Liberal Logic . No wonder they are a dying breed . Natural Selection ...
@f800gecko @CPC_HQ @liberal_party @NDP When ? No major party has ever ran on introducing pro-life legislation . No one knows with certitude ( yet ) on whether voters would vote for or against such a platform . What we do know is that the only time the @CPC_HQ won a majority is when they had a pro-life campaign policy .
Trump appointee , Amb . Kelly Craft : " We cannot accept references to ' sexual and reproductive health , ' [ ... ] or language that would promote abortion or suggest a right to abortion ” Pretty tone deaf in a disc . abt survivors of sexual & gender-based violence
@MorganeOgerBC @massdelusion9 Most Canadians were on board to add protection for GNC . Very few actually agree with being forced to identify as male or female by brain type & erase the hard win rights against discrimination against women for their reproductive sex . @JustinTrudeau cdnpoli
@Education4Libs Exactly and I ’ m old enough to remember when they legalized Abortion New York was the only state where one past 1st trimester could get a legal Abortion at Their Own Expense . Now the government will pay for your Abortion up to and After birth ! ! ! No to Gun Control

@PadreMusa Superficial rebuttal : It is hardly surprising that a Catholic nun was pro-life . The church teaches that suffering born well is a path to sanctification so it is also not surprising that a nun held that . Media reports of one's goodness are not the basis of canonisation

@NoToMisogyny 👨 ‍ 👩 ‍ 👧 ‍ 👧 🇳 🇿 I don ’ t really want to debate pro life vs pro abortion but I would disagree either position is primarily a political one . Abortion is a very complex issue . I think everyone should have a voice in the discussion as long as it ’ s not promoting personal harm to other commentators
By that logic , no one has more right to speak on reproductive rights than abortion regretters like Abby Johnson who worked for Planned Parenthood and saw the reproductive care industry from the inside . Is that really the hill you're willing to die on ? Pro Trans Pro Choice
What is even going on in this tweet ? Women deserve better than this .

@Cici_94Percent @smith_pat1944 @RealCandaceO First of all Trump doesn't have a racist bone in his body and secondly I'm not judging based on political affiliation I'm based on moral affiliation anyone who supports the murder of babies via abortion is not a Christian .

@thehill @JessieJaneDuff Hillary , Obama and the democrats kept an abortion clinic in every black and hispanic neighborhood to improve social mobility . think of that racist democrat lie , if you have children you can't be successful so abort your babies !

Dr . Tasha Dubriwny talks about her research on the rhetoric of contemporary reproductive rights and the role a Glasscock Center Fellowship has played in making it possible this semester :
@POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse ... we are going to take away women ’ s rights , we are going to threaten our allies to have them slander a competitor , we are going to reward the top 1 % , we are going to slander war heroes , we are going have a journalist murdered

@USCCB Gentlemen , there are 3 abortion mills in Baltimore open today : Hillcrest Clinic , American Women Services , Planned Parenthood . Probably 150 babies murdered daily . Are you going to take time to go there and pray for them . To help stop the slaughter ? Are you afraid ? Shame on you .

Supporting some regulation of medical procedures ( including abortion ) does not negate the bodily autonomy of the patient as long as it is in service of discharging the obligation of the State to protect the patient's right to health .

@Williams96Dylan @doby13lee @deyanira527 @PlayOverwatch I honestly support abortion though , not in Chinas case cause their population is kinda gonna go to shit if they keep that up , but here in America I feel like women should have a choice .
I really don ’ t get why people who clearly been through an abortion and hopefully never have too , have so much to say in what ’ s right / wrong . Like have they thought about people who have been raped ? Or people who are financially or mentally struggle to be able to care for a child ?
@djourada @vixmcintyre @RitaPanahi Of course it does . " Pro life " insistence of assigning certain characteristics to a fetus ( emotions , concept of innocence , gender etc ) is an appeal to emotion , rather than being based on fact .
@IndivisibleTeam Kentucky is ~ 85 % pro choice . The GOP is delusional to run on anti-women , anti-equal rights platform .
@SCGOP Expand Medicaid - some “ pro-life ” party y ’ all are 😡 😡
If Catholics actually had a sense of solidarity , abortion would have been illegal 40 years ago . But the prolife leaders only care about money and vanity ( being saints ) . They don't reach out , organize people in an effective way . I have a different approach , which is solidary .

@mackenzieblaire Actually , you cannot get rid of the second amendment since it is part of " The Bill of Rights " and I believe the should be a ban on all assault weapons .

@tcuci42 @Farrdawg101 @LiveAction @MarisaInCali The site , " Clinic Quotes " was started by a Lesbian Atheist , so it's not religious ... but it describes details of Abortion procedures , from Docs , Nurses , Techs , who performed them . It's very eye-opening .
Are they protesting for abortion or that babies shouldn't be cuddled ? Are did they just want to make fools of themselves and let us know to avoid the hospital they work at ?
Way past time for churches to lose their tax-exempt status . Franklin Graham calls on pastors and priests to deny pro-choice politicians communion like one just did to Joe Biden
How not to be Catholic by a priest !
@JohnnaMarotta I did read it . You implied that abortion is not terrible because 400k + kids in foster would ’ ve been better off aborted . If that ’ s not what you implied , please elaborate .
WE NEED VOTER ID ! democrats will cheat to win !
@KikkiPlanet I do hate that men get dragged into this . It is a religious thing . There are just as many women that support this too . Now Mrs Smith I am all on your side and am pro choice .

@BellonaRevived IIRC Mother Theresa condemned contraception in her speech accepting the Nobel peace prize . She said contraception is equal to abortion which is equal to murder .

You can now access all existing US abortion data in one place thanks to @LozierInstitute .
@CathAttic But fair enough--miscarriage ITSELF won't be a felony . But the devil is in the details . This series of articles talk about some of the complexity around all this , and how banning early-term abortion may have unintended consequences .
@TracyLou3 @NoNameGirl8686 Stop thinking in terms of sides . It accomplishes nothing . You guys have exaggerated some things on the right , the right has done the same back . NO ONE is taking birth control away . Abortion shouldn't be used in excess . Restraint is better than killing infants .

@itssonoisy I mean , this is my belief . I don ’ t have sex with someone unless we ’ re in a committed relationship and I ’ m open to having kids with them . Because you can never be too safe and personally I would not want to get an abortion . So there are SOME purposes to sexual purity .

@SpeakerPelosi Liberals have no moral controlling authority to follow . They have no GOD . They are their own GOD . How else could you support a party who supports the murder of babies up to birth . Abortion is a safety net for their uncontrollable desire to have irresponsible sex . Nothing else .
Warning : The new over population hoax will be used to justify abortion and far far worse “ The Scientists Are Muttering About Population Control Again ” The one thing that all environmentalists have in common is a hatred of humanity
@reproaction If we want to jail people it will be the doctors that perform the abortions and the institutions both lie to women about the procedure , the outcomes , and about ending the life of the unborn . Abortion is not a treatment of any disease . Abortion kills a human being .
@Sam_DeLoach 😆 Pro Life is the most selfish movement I've ever come across . It's all about HowYouFeel and why we should all follow your Ideology . Its really easy to Project your Feelings onto a fetus and call yourself noble , isn't it ? It'll accept it quietly , but we won't .

@sunilkpal @tanjoolee In Islam , it is believed that the foetus has a soul after 19 weeks , therefore abortion is not permissible . In general , abortion is allowed for life-threatening conditions . I would refrain , even for myself , to comment on what the Koran says unless you ’ ve read it back to back .

@thethirstymayor @LeahNTorres Good thing abortion isn ’ t murder , and they fact is well established . So you ’ ve made an irrational statement .
@jjflaherty12 @LilaGraceRose When they do bother to cover abortion , they talk about developments in the law . Abortion is exponentially safer than childbirth . They don ’ t pay much attention to maternal mortality . Pregnancy actually kills women . Hundreds of them . Also , my body is just none of your damn business

@JoshuaHol because the Democratic party isn't nearly as monolithic in their beliefs as the GOP is . The GOP can run and get elected off of : 1 . guns 2 . abortion That's it . They don't even have to ACTUALLY do anything on either of those issues , just say Dems will . Boom , elected .

Since I have an audience : my Great Grandmother helped women give birth or terminate pregnancies . Being prochoice runs in my blood . Prochoice means you support whatever decisions the person who is pregnant makes . Wants / needs an abortion ? Get it . Want to have a full litter ? Do it
@EvelinOlsen2014 @QuantumBackflow @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Luisa , your mention of abortion was touching . Thank you for juxtaposing Quantum ’ s “ kids in cages ” & “ evil ” versus slaughtering the unborn in the womb . Matthew 7:3 is appropriate here . It ’ s the passage about the splinter in your brothers eye but fail to see the log in you own .
To date , I've seen to advocacy from Big Pharma for legalized abortion though which leads me to believe they aren't scared of a baby curing cancer someday . Because the cure is already out there and they know it .
Surprising no one , polls find that a majority of Americans oppose Trump's crack down on birth control , women's health care :
@mimimuffins2 @HarvelaHarvey @amidgley @mishtal @lmharpin @UKLabour @jc @JewishChron The worst you can accuse Kate Ramsden of , from what I can see , is poor choice of words . Indeed , the article seems to be saying clearly that if you are critical of Israel you will be smeared as an anti-Semite .
@Donal_OKeeffe Ticklist of bog-standard insults but no answers from the creepy anti-choice middle-aged white male who wants other people's children to learn about sex , can't explain why , can't elaborate on what they should learn or who should do the teaching . But WE'RE the judgmental ones . Ok .
This is Kate . Her pro-choice message reads " Because every woman knows what is right for her . " She is Proudly Pro Choice

@Suttdaddy @DailyCaller Well if you don ’ t like how his UBI will come close to eradicating poverty , perhaps you ’ ll like how it will lead to plummeting abortion rates . Yang is consequently the most pro-life candidate :
@MountainXeer @atheist_in_nc @Goodbye_Jesus And if a soul lives forever doesn ’ t abortion assure that a person will live happily ever after instead of tortured forever by your god if they are gay ir atheist or believe the wrong magic story ! It ’ s insurance ! Why have a kid if it can be tortured FOREVER ?
@SJGreenHart I won't go into too many details , but I once stood up for a rape victim's right to have an abortion---the victim was a woman I knew well . One individual , however , decided that I was worthy of hell for defending her decision . I did not mourn the loss of that man's friendship .
@PPFA Murder is a social construct I define abortion as murder
@JaramilloPhil @StudentsforLife Have you ever been to Planned Parenthood ? Because I have and I got help with my health and comfort and consolation . I also know they have provided protection from predators to others in my life . Hell they helped a friend find a divorce lawyer .
@BKsFromTexas Ya know what its bull i did it i got 59 % so i was like huh ? So i clicked it and for the abortion answer i said : pro choice but the one it compared me to said that they were prolife etc so yeah they were all a bit like that

One is a procedure where you ’ re literally put down and they go in with a tube and suck out the fetus , a lot of women do this who can ’ t have the pill form . Once again , why am i educating you ? Just fuck off , you both crossed a line .
@Kathy8s @WWRRDNOW @elianatrue @MarilynnKobza @realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom @DonaldJTrumpJr He doesn ’ t have to pass a bill . That ’ s the way it works . Not through fake hoaxes .

Intolerance is by nature an anti-freedom , pro authoritarian ideology . It ’ s social communism . You can ’ t be pro freedom and intolerant to speech , choice & thought you don ’ t like .
Hopefully a brother bishop will revisit this with + McElroy . The Holy Father never said that abortion wasn ’ t a preeminent priority .
The same group of people that are “ pro-life ” support this type of hypocrisy . Don ’ t be a fool , if you ’ re not about taking care of all children , from conception to death you ’ re not a real christian , catholic , or a decent human for that matter .
@Aella_Girl @wglane3 Pro-abortion arguments sound sane too . But at the end of the day , it's killing a baby . Anything else is rationalization .
This would be a fab time to plug planned parenthood . You know , the place that people think only permit abortions ... they test . (: and give you 2 day results for some samples Non insured folks can set up payments Y ’ all stop playing

What kind of monster of a person do you have to be to think abortion should be commonplace ? That is a hideous stance . So freaking disgusting . I ’ m not sure “ forgive them father for they know not what they do ” covers this . They know exactly what they ’ re doing . Put That In Your Pipe

@MatthewCronin9 To equate laws with stopping men from raping as the same as stopping women from getting abortion is beyond stupid . Honestly , you should be ashamed of yourself for making such a stupid argument .

Ya gotta love men deciding that foetuses are more important than their mothers , wives and daughters . Talk about being full of themselves .
@plainlyevident @pinkheretic " Believe in abortion " is a classic example of misguided phraseology applied to things it shouldn't . There's nothing to believe . One is OK with it , or not . Secondly , you commit another argumental fallacy in stating as fact that which is under debate : the existence of god .

Shut up 😂 It ’ s OKAY to be selfish . It ’ s OKAY to choose yourself over an unborn life . If a woman isn ’ t comfortable enough or knows she isn ’ t fully prepared to take on the responsibilities of carrying and raising a child , it ’ s OKAY to get an abortion .

If a 16 - year-old wanted to adopt a child , the government wouldn't allow it . She isn't done with her education , she can't financially support herself , and she isn't a legal adult . But if she gets pregnant , the government can ban her from getting an abortion How is that logical

So while liberals scream “ think of the kids ” about schools and “ um not those kids ” about abortion , conservatives are actually consistent .
One of the best ways of avoiding problems caused by conscientiously objecting doctors is to allow abortion to be provided by conscientiously committed non-docs such as nurses , midwives , HCAs who already do all manner of clinical procedures .

@Aidan52420511 In 1973 , I had no problem with an early term abortion because I thought that I was just eliminating ‘ a glob of cells ’ . Years later , even at 14 weeks , I didn ’ t think of that developing ‘ thing ’ as a person . ( 1 of 2 )

@blondedtaleah I think since they like to do it I've started branding " pro-lifers " as " anti-choice " since they brand " pro-choice " as " pro abortion " , as if we wanna abort every person in the third trimester

Advocating with Planned Parenthood for the continuation of abortions until birth is not how New Hampshire people feel about late term abortion . This was essentially passed with no input from the public by Planned Parenthood and Senator then Gov . Shaheen .
I mean you could take responsibility for waffling on access to abortion . Or on whether your candidates can be separatists or not . Clearly the GPC has a lot to learn before they choose their next leader .

@BeeAmellia A baby is a completely seperate body . Calling it your body is scientifically incorrect and justification for abortion . If a woman doesn ’ t want a baby , she should protect herself with contraception ( which when used correctly rarely fails ) OR abstain instead of murdering a baby .

I agree with your point there is a real question about should we have laws at all regarding abortion or let someone ’ s religion determine where the line should be drawn . I myself am not hurt by abortions .
This is the anti-choice movement . These whites and men are trying to prevent me from sterilizing myself which is within my rights to do . I already had two children and carrying them almost killed me . I never want to be pregnant again .
You know when you can just TELL someone isn't smarter than a doctor !
Anti-homeless laws criminalize the types of life-sustaining activities that homeless people have no choice but to undertake in public . Of 187 cities measured by the @NLCHPhomeless : - 27 % prohibit sleeping - 61 % prohibit panhandling - 47 % prohibit sitting and lying down
@alketrolyat @LouisatheLast Yes . My abortion was 1 . an easy decision and 2 . actually hilarious because it resulted in me accidentally bleeding all over Trump Tower . I respect that it ’ s a tough experience for some , but our experiences can and must co-exist in the narrative .

@BLH4House @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump brandon , if anyone is having a late term abortion , it is because something went horribly wrong with a wanted pregnancy . these are women who have likely picked out names , decorated nurseries , made arrangements for daycare . would you rather they carry an unviable fetus til it dies ?

@seanfeucht @Hansivere @omarlopez1 Sean don ’ t you mean anti-abortion ? After all , do you believe in life after birth ? How can you have a pro life stance and not fight for the life of all people who are met with injustice by our society ! Anti-abortion is different than Prolife !

Loyola Marymount may be diverse , but it has a history of anti-choice , misogynist policies . It's one of two Catholic institutions that tried to exclude abortion coverage from employee health plans in 2013 . It's an inappropriate venue for @DNC debate .
@RemnantPodFan @FMesstm @RapeWhistle3 @Stilbongod Yes , rights and personhood are upheld by legislation . That ’ s why abortion is legislated as a healthcare right . Your personal beliefs are the opposite for abortion though . We both have access to the same information & have made our choices

Dear Catholic Twitter , priests , bishops , pundits , “ pro-life ” folks ... THIS is why it is immoral 2 try 2 convince ppl 2 vote 4 what u consider 2 be “ pro-life ” candidates when ALL you base that on is who will try 2 make abortion illegal . The party that sells itself as , “ pro-life ”

@HorsesAreBetter Regardless of your opinion on abortion , I don't think this is giving the right impression regarding trauma ... Everyone has varying levels of trauma and it's about how you get through it . Not comparing it to something so drastically as to not be here . Different things .

It ’ s awful that pregnancy centers want to see more heartbeats saved than extinguished is a take I expected from the abortion industry . The constant attack on pregnancy centers just proves that our model is working and the abortion industry is struggling to find an answer .

@guy_storz @FishpawLu @JillFilipovic The term you're looking for is pro-choice . And nobody is saying that late-term abortion should be readily available , no questions asked . This should only be utilised if the woman is medically at risk .

@GuruAnaerobic They aren't all pro-abortion . For the ones that are , I doubt they're anti animal abortion . You're just taking as an assumption that terminating a pregnancy is the same thing as exploiting a living thing , which is the abortion argument in the first place . Nothing new stated here .

@tiaxlynn I dont agree tht getting an abortion after youve been raped ect is getting rid of a baby for ur own selfish wants ? Or even terminating when u have absolutely no way to care for said baby ? In necessary situations its literally one of the most selfless things u can do in my opinion

@AdamJSchwarz Brexit isn't a binary choice . There are several forms of Brexit . Giving voters only a choice of Johnson's anti-worker deal or Remain is hugely undemocratic - it disenfranchises millions who voted Leave or accept the 2016 decision . It would produce either a hard Brexit or strife .

. @StephHerold points out the dozens of problems in this @people article about medication abortion . Adding one more — it ’ s 2019 and most US experts call it medication abortion not medical abortion ( an ambiguous term ) . Hope this prompts a revised article from a real abortion expert .
At Planned Parenthood , we ’ re committed to connecting people to accurate , timely information about their abortion options and where they can get care — no matter what . That ’ s why we ’ ve launched the Abortion Care Finder : Abortion Is Health Care

Abortion . I've been thinking about this a lot , because it's often cited as the one reason that people hold their nose and vote for the GOP . And I wonder if someone would like to talk to me about this .
@emilyslist You ’ re a baby-killer . I ’ ll vote for anyone who opposes you and I won ’ t have anything to do with pro-abortion women . And stop promoting this on my timeline . Now you ’ re blocked .
Welp , it appears literally any rubbish can get by published by @WSJopinion including this delusional dispatch by @RepChrisSmith Again , the patriarchy values the profound confused rantings of man who ’ s scared of women having agency over their own bodies
@ZubyMusic What about pregnant women with a cancer diagnosis ? Denying her an abortion , prevents her from getting treatment . Deciding whether to continue with pregnancy or not is a horrible decision to have to make , but it shd be her decision . You ’ d get treated straight away , why shdnt she ?
WESTERNERS ? HAVE LESS CHILDREN ? ? I thought that ’ s what legalised full term abortion was intended for . Yet more proof of the global push to breed out whites and replace with 3rd world cockroach infestation we currently see INVADING the west . FCUK YOU ... IM GONNA FCUK MORE
@detective26AD The battle on abortion has nothing to do with the definition of life , nor does it matter . So-called pro-life organizations pretending to care about fetal personhood is smoke & mirrors to hide the fact it ’ s about stopping the threat of women asserting their right to live 1 /

Republican legislators in South Carolina are stripping exceptions to rape and incest from an already draconian abortion ban . If this becomes law , women will die . Let ’ s be clear on that .
I ’ m constantly talking about how outdated this line of thinking is but it ’ s also worth remembering that a lot of real people ’ s lives will take a turn for the worse if the Democrats take a knee on abortion , criminal justice , immigration , LGBTQ rights , etc . It ’ s not just abstract .

@StuartChambers9 @scottmhayward @stphnmaher @CPC_HQ You ’ re wrong about the SCC Morgentaler decision ( seem to be confusing it with the USA Ror v . Wade ) . The plurality didn ’ t rule that there was a right to abortion in the Charter , they said the requirement for approval from a Therapeutic Abortion Committee was not constitutional .
@HuffPost To be clear no doctor can share that . The minute she becomes sexually active she has a right to her privacy . In NYC if she became pregnant and wanted an abortion he won't even know . They can't share .
The unborn baby is nothing to the abortionist . They told her they would break the baby's neck if born alive . That's murder ! Please pass this around and contact you State and Federal representatives .

@iam_karonga @Khaya08974763 Abortion is a choice and abortion is not something to be ashamed of . A woman does not carry a child for nine months , you carry that child your whole entire life and the sad reality is that more often than not a woman does the bulk of raising a child on her own .

There's no compromise with that shit , and suggestions that it's the keys responsibility to find it are laughable .
@RadioFreeTom @RedState Tom longs for the good old days before his brand of respectable Republicans didn ’ t have the power to do things like repeal Obamacare or defund Planned Parenthood and therefore couldn ’ t be revealed as liars and hypocrites .
@QuoteMeOnThatK @trinko @ALReproRightsAd @ReproRights Unborn children do NOT poison , suction , slice , dice , dismember & bloody exsanguinate to death their mothers ; mothers do that to their unborn children ! Facts Matter Learn the difference between murderer & murder victim . Prolife TRUMPS Murder By Abortion @POTUS is Prolife KAG2020
@NJCathi @DontTreadOnBaby @ilyseh @parscale " The only righteous abortion was my own . " Classic gaslighting .

Natalie Kanem , ED UNFPA " The reproductive rights of women and girls are not up for compromise . Zero is the only acceptable number for UNFPA . Zero instances of women dying during childbirth , zero child and forced marriages , zero instances of violence against women . nairobisummit
@stephaniemagui4 @jcgilley1 @joshjame Sanders called women ’ s rights a “ fringe issue ” or a distraction once when he stumped for the one pro-life dem in the middle of the country . Many men said well would you rather the republican win ? And that ’ s showing lack of understanding .
So happy to be building power with the fine folks @lilithfund ! Join us tonight as we celebrate the power of abortion storytelling .
When you tell your pregnant girlfriend “ are we having a boy or an abortion “
@LiveAction Nope . Let me have my reproductive rights
@CoolSEOMD @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump You posted videos of someone pretending to be a pregnant woman giving herself an abortion in response to a conversation about election results last night . I'm pretty sure this is a parody account
Trump ’ s Impeachable Offenses : 111 . ) Trump ’ s Title X rule removes vital resources for women & directly takes away their ability to access essential healthcare services . Attacking women ’ s health for ANY reason is unacceptable . He ’ s doing it for no reason .
When I was pro-choice I defended it by asking " what about the women who died seeking illegal abortions ? " This article makes it clear the abortion ' doctors ' didn't give a shit about women and only wanted money . They could not care less if their patients died .

Giving a baby a family , yes he took money but the women went to him for an abortion . He still had to pay staff and who ever was his contact person in Akron Ohio plus abortion was illegal if u take risks u need to pay people The End result was A Child born
I'm pro choice but I also know R's use it as a political weapon , they make it harder which hurts but they never go all the way . I'm glad to see it losing some of it's thunder even on their side .
A White Gay Christian Who Supports Abortion ! Buttigieg Is A Racist Buttigieg Is A Baby Killer
Abortion survivor speaks out : “ They don ’ t care about my right to choose , I definitely would not have chosen not to be aborted ”
We are in Belfast where same-sex couples and Marriage Equality campaigners have gathered ahead of the midnight deadline which will see equal marriage and reproductive rights extended to Northern Ireland .
@StacyMarksberry @GregR19709804 @JessLuvsTrump The only thing that Bevin has going for him is his " pro-life " stance . That's the reason everyone I know personally that voted for him did .
@DavidNmundia Your argument is not valid . It ’ s not apples to apples . If a female President had an abortion that would be a better comparison . And if I voted for that female president who had an abortion would that mean I support abortion ? No .
@bonhoefferchild @MattWalshBlog We see abortion as the intentional killing of an innocent human being . And so we oppose it . It does not mean that I am only truly opposed to the extermination of the innocent if I go out and rescue every innocent person about to be killed ... That's an absurd requisite .
Justice is on the ballot . Healthcare , education , LGBTQ rights , reproductive rights , gun reform , workers rights , etc ; we are fighting for an America that works for the people and not a select few . The stakes are high and we must bring it on home in 2020 !

@trac284 @LiveAction @PammyC10 Seriously ! Do you believe that the USA is allowing women to commit MURDER by having an abortion ? If it's legal then the courts do NOT view it as murder ; therefore , an abortion is NOT murder . ALWAYS Pro Choice to allow the choice to be yours ! Support your choice ! @PPAdvocatesPA
Vote Red Monroe Prolife The ones who really need to see this 👉 Dems Dems2020 Vote Blue Lib politicians don't care about you or your unborn child . They only want to profit from the sale of their body parts . Sick . Walk Away from this evil ! Love Saves Lives
YASS ! ! ! And I would like to remind everyone that he was running against that dude who said he'd get an anti-choice bill passed in Virginia . Pro Choice Boy BYE
@_AlexHirsch @WSJ @greg_ip I ’ m gonna get a free abortion every week !
@ndrew_lawrence @charliearchy So he just admitted he ’ s pro choice too ?
Abp Naumann is head of bishops ' prolife committee . His presentation is on the importance of a pastoral response to the needs of pregnant women , regardless of the status of abortion laws . Talks about immense challenges facing homeless , poor , unmarried women . USCCB19
Let me see if I understand abortion correctly : If you ’ ve managed to survive long enough to be able to reproduce , your rights trample those on the other side of the womb . Correct ? abortion prolife
@charliekirk11 Planned Parenthood also provides affordable STI screenings , which is pretty nifty with 1.7 million cases of chlamydia in 2018 in the US . If only there was comprehensive sex education to teach people how to protect themselves from STIs ... education that PP also provides
Really delighted to apart of this stellar edited collection exploring intersectionality beyond equality and non-discrimination law . My own contribution will be looking at how CEDAW accounts for the role of rurality in women and girl's sexual and reproductive health rights !
GOP today is evil . Trump is evil . Pence is evil . McConnell is evil . Putin is just Putin .
@Pro_life_ANCAP @Buzzsaws1990 @Sam_DeLoach @_celia_bedelia_ But the fetus didn't live on its own or breath air or eat or anything yet ... so ... again , what's the point ? You can go ahead and have the last word , it's cool .
I am . It ’ s one area I disagree with Pete on . But one area of disagreement isn ’ t gonna stop me from supporting policies I think will help improve lives . Same way I think most of Trumps policies are good despite me hating the things he says out his mouth on a regular .
@parscale He is pro-choice , pro-Medicaid expansion , pro-ACA and pro-public school teachers . By Kentucky standards , that ’ s a socialist .
NO .

adoption eugenics : using the vague and subjective adoption requirements to infringe upon the reproductive rights of those who can not reproduce .
And Add , Screwups Education System 😁 😃
@HerringPhilly @dbaria Sir you are making assumptions . You ’ ve heard what ASSUmptions do . I do support teacher pay raises and I support raising the gas tax to improve infrastructure . As a Christian I will not under any circumstances vote for anyone that will not even consider restrictions on abortion
