@IlanaPL This is prob not going to excite some anti-abortion leaders , many of whom are conservative Catholics + evangelicals . ‚Äú The contraceptive mentality is what has led to abortion in America today , ‚Äù Kristan Hawkins said . ‚Äú Loving a woman and empowering her is not putting her on a drug . ‚Äù
@JohnCarltonKing @bouillabae @mattyglesias It bothers me because when we muddy the definitions we use , people who are actually pro choice but call themselves pro life think that people who call themselves pro choice are disparaging them when we talk about pro-lifers .
But from those statements , are you looking for some excuses to do an abortion ? It's not justified as well . You do know that every single act you take would have its own risk .

@baimcpher Youre wrong there are people who have kids AND HAVE HAD MISCARRIAGES and still are prochoice . You care more about a " child " that isnt born yet more than someone who is alive and trying to survive . Why do unborn lives matter to you more than a living girl / woman does ?

@emilyslist Please ! Abortion as birth control would be unnecessary if promiscuous guys would get vascectamies . Unlike abortion , vascectamies are noninvasive , reversible and not permanently damaging to his reproductive parts , but stay blind to pro-choice and how it's more beneficial to women .

Look we can snark about conservatives and tracking periods but the reality is enforcing abortion bans means the government is going to have to know who is pregnant and who is * potentially * pregnant and period tracking is one way that happens

@sparktherevolt @TheBabylonBee Why is drug induced abortion off limits , unacceptable , or in poor taste .

To be blunt . Abortion isn ‚Äô t about equality . It ‚Äô s about pure power . Power over life . Power over the innocent . Power over being a woman . Power over men and children . There ‚Äô s multiple parties injured every time a child is executed .

@nytimes For all those the took " the bait " : Yes , not getting vaccinated DOES impact the lives of others in a detrimental way . Just like in an abortion ( where we also hear this phrase ) . So , we've all proved here today that the bodily autonomy argument is actually pretty weak . Thanks ! !

@knitting4nepal @FishpawLu @JillFilipovic What do you mean by pro-choice ? Does the father get a choice ? Does the baby ? If she has the baby , can the man choose not to have anything to do with it ?

@detective26AD Though many conservatives would say that pregnancy from rape is rare , there ‚Äô s no proof that it is rare . And even if it is rare , abortion should always be an option in such a case . Also , sometimes the baby develops in a way that make it impossible to survive outside the womb .
@walnutdoor84 @MSNBC Again your profession is a choice . Abortion is often a necessary evil and your opinion shouldn ‚Äô t be the one to decide what a mother deems best for herself . If you can ‚Äô t handle it do something else .
As I still would have chosen abortion over a drug damaged baby to care for provide for or have to give up to the systems to care for if damaged enough I know where I stand .
@SamWhiteTky They can't see past his ' toff ' exterior and his religion . When pressed about abortion , he will always point out that he can't support it due to his religion , but would never judge others . It's for an individual's own conscience . He accepts the UK law on abortion as it stands .

@ZubyMusic I think its more related to when the human life is worth something , Thought provokasie was a comment " if I was born on the 25th , what was I worth on the 24th ? " I however stil think abortion is better than a baby with an unloving mother , commiting sucide in teens . Life is shit .

This is the " pro-life " party . They only care about children when they are in utero . After that , they should probably get off their lazy asses , get a job with benefits , and quit being a drain on society .
What a ghastly spectacle of elite cosiness and hypocrisy is the Catholic funeral of Gay Byrne . A huge gathering of pro abortion anti Catholic forces aided and abetted by the Archbishop of Dublin .
Clearly the anti-choice movement is not motivated by honesty . Why else would they take issue with California asking fake clinics to reveal that they are unlicensed , while supporting forcing doctors to lie to their patients about abortion reversal ?

What have the republicans done ? Try to take away health care , made money for billionaires & refuse to raise minimum wage . Fighting ACA about pre-existing conditions , fighting to take away females reproductive rights . They are the take away party . Steal from SS / Medicare / aid .
@ewarren There's only one candidate in this race that plans to take women's reproductive rights with her to the Oval office .
@senatemajldr and Paul Ryan have let us down with new ideas and the wall & Planned Parenthood . Time to go around these dinosaurs and have Trump create the bills for house members to use as legislation and skip the lobbyists
@vlweatherford The other real problem as noted by Hal Singer is the failure of regulators to hold the line on anti-trust duopoly and monopoly actors . It ‚Äô s akin to a tax üôÄ on consumers ( less choice - airlines , media , comma ) & small business ; and made worse by GOP fondness for arbitration clauses
@CelestialShips @stephsretreat @MellyCara @peytnhaag @kmalko_16 I mean if they can guarantee that my child would be cared for and loved , then yes abortion should be illegal but nope , based on what I saw kids go through with this so called system is horrifying . Let a woman make a choice with her body , it's her hardship and hers alone .
Parental Refusal of vaccines from @JenniferReich1 : anti-vaccine organizations use the language of " your child " and choice . It's persuasive and powerful for powers , at least some . Especially when there are limited links with healthcare providers .

Planned Parenthood is not just an abortion facility . They provide several other resources for women and reproductive health .

@Pro_life_ANCAP @WJHirschi @DrJenGunter They also assume that 1 ) the only people against abortion are Christians , 2 ) Christianity is bad , 3 ) abortion is good , ergo 4 ) the only way to be against abortion , which makes you bad , is to be Christian .

@UCanCaIlMe I grew up in a similar situation . But if anyone got pregnant , they would have had an abortion . Things are very different in Hawaii . It ‚Äô s a very fertile place . ( And my kids claim a lot of local kids around here aren ‚Äô t great about using birth control . )
