@ColeenMassoni @ChatByCC @DonaldJTrumpJr You ’ re a really twisted pig 🐖 Colleen . Religious people voted for him because he ’ s anti abortion and appoints pro life judges . Not because anyone cares about a rude comment said in private 15 years ago ! Liberals Are Twisted And Sick
Tomorrow is a very important day in the Commonwealth ! Please go vote . Matt Bevin has said some things I do not agree with . However , I will support him because of his position on these issues . - Abortion is WRONG . - Ilegal immigration is WRONG . - The 2nd Amendment is important .

Judge Blocks Alabama Pro-Life Law Banning Abortions , Protecting Unborn Babies
@sockettoomey @JohnFugelsang So what have you ever done to actually prevent an abortion ?
“ Abortion , a woman ’ s right to choose ” . Here ’ s a brilliant idea , not groundbreaking … But it escapes many . How about you use that right to CHOOSE to take your birth control ? To keep your legs closed ? ! 🙄
@GodlessLib_CB @MalikAlMamalik It ’ s more about rhetoric and what we focus on . You can ignore social issues and still win . Kentucky Governor is pro choice and pro lgbt and will protect those issues as governor but he didn ’ t mention them at all on campaign bc it that would given Bevin major amo
Same lady who went to a public school and told 13yo girls their abortion rights were being infringed on ( without getting parents permission first ) . Sick lady .

@dougbrec @EricRee84778243 @Bishopoftyler There are degrees to sin , abortion has preeminence . Do you disagree and is that your point ?
Bailey , people who have made their own informed decisions are not insane . They are educated . Sincerely , a sane , pro-choice mother .
This is the saddest situation , I ’ m so ashamed of it . It seems as if it ’ s just one of the things that ’ s happened that nobody cares about . It ’ s like the abortion rate it gets greater and greater and nobody says anything , like no one wants to stand up and say this is got to STOP .
@alanspade @W_Jamie @BGPolitics @AndyBeshearKY It's a part of it sure . The economy would be the biggest issue for GOP voters and the working class in my opinion . We're a solid pro-life state , there's not a single law that denies civil rights to those folks that's been passed , and Donald Trump is a national concern .
This is basically it in a nutshell , then add the Russian collusion thing , and the blackmail ...
@learning2fly6 @alvedaking I disagree , it is not God's Will to rape or commit incest , that is a choice the offending individual makes against God's Will . The consequences carries pain and hardships . I cannot condemn a rape or incest victim for choosing abortion provided the abortion occurs before Pain .

@YoginiCamper @Buzzsaws1990 @Sam_DeLoach @_celia_bedelia_ I'm just pointing out your error , as I have done all along .
@jperky1956 I think that is a woman's right say " Yes " or " No " when she is asked if she wants to have sex . If a woman is raped thus deprived of the ability to say " No " , that situation is different and an abortion within 2 weeks or so is Okay . Nobody should kill a baby for any other reason .
The roundabout by the Eureka branch of Planned Parenthood is not hard to navigate yet most can ’ t .
@FoxPrintsArt @HumphreyBarry @NARAL @MattBevin Pro-choice are NOT pro abortion ? then what are they ? What about the rights of the little woman in the womb ? do they have NO rights ? Making abortion illegal makes it more dangerous ? for who ? the mother who wants to kill her baby ? disgusting !
Mi pare tutto coerente no ?
@IGN
... because that'd just have been too awkward to tell these women to change their " favourite woman " on a poster . Which is more important than making Jewish people feel safe or not upholding things like forced conversions or pro-life beliefs ?

“ The Democratic Party ’ s abortion fanaticism is demonic “ .. the driving ideology behind the Democratic Party in America has evolved from a tacit approval and defense of legalized child killing to a macabre celebration of the ritual . ”
@thehill 🤔 The guy was from Planned Parenthood .
@Tgdraw @peytnhaag no one is pro-abortion . its called pro-choice for a reason . their body , their choice . you dont have to get an abortion if you dont want to , but dont tell someone what they can or cant do with their body . not everyone is financially , physically , or even mentally ready for a child .
If you ’ re anti-abortion and the GOP won ’ t have you , go change the GOP ! Or consider whether it MIGHT JUST MIGHT be that anti-abortion politics are specifically about the oppression of marginalized people and that there ’ s a reason Dems aren ’ t willing to budge on that one .
@RRosalski @jmcappiello I don't eat animals but many animal campaigners do , I see your point .

I don ’ t appreciate their swipe at @ameliabonow or @lizzwinstead & she missed a chance to make important point - who gets to decide is an important existential question re : bodily autonomy which we currently have in life & death . Winning arguments isn ’ t goal . Increasing empathy is
Good thread - and my future daughter in law works at Planned Parenthood . I proudly support her and this organization !

@zestymarguerita @tozierdads i don ’ t think they ’ re close minded at all ? ? ? if anything the whole basis of the conversation is that jeremy is ? ? ? & u don ’ t know what type of experience some 1 has with abortion nor how personal it is to them so them being upset & having a strong dislike towards him is valid
dlaczego wasze pro-life kończy się na dziecku i nie sięga kobiety , która to dziecko musi donosić i urodzić , bo ktoś jej karze ? i nawet nie mówcie o oddaniu do domu dziecka czy milionach par pragnących adoptowanego dziecka , wpierw odwiedźcie może jakiś dom dziecka ...
@reawakened_m That's the sad thing . I think even a little goes a long way and as long as there is the option of medical abortion it will help a great deal . Afger that a person can receive proper education and support to avoid it in the future . You never know they can teach & help others later
This has been true for awhile ... but the below should be a clear sign that the VA Rep . Party needs a complete reboot - starting with their leadership & their consultants . Blame migration and guv'munt workers in NoVA all you want ; but that is just ignoring the problem .

@Timcast Abortion , Tim . It's the same thing .
You knowww instead of focusing on abortion and planned parenthood we could put our efforts into DHS and other child protective services and get these kids homes WITH PARENTS THAT WANT THEM ... just a thought .

@DavidJHarrisJr I continue to be shocked that women have been brainwashed into believing abortion is a good thing
@LifeNewsHQ Abortion should have never been allowed in this country . Look at how it has changed people to have no respect for human life . Sad , this country needs prayers and a spiritual revival to come back to God . When Roe vs Wade was allowed it opened the gates of hell . R . I . P . unborn .

@NoApologies1776 @PPFA Rebel without a clue - you're so misguided . @PPFA - STD testing & treatment , birth control , well-woman exams , cancer screening prevention , abortion , hormone therapy , infertility services , and general health care . But prolly not hymen checking .
Harper also said he would not ' reopen ' the abortion debate , then he did . But because his back bench did it , he could claim it was ' forced ' upon him . This is a shit-ball technique Canada's Reform Party Conservatives learned from U . S . politics ; Jesus Scheer would have done it too .
@TheRightMelissa The abortion eugenic machinery is tantamount to the Climate change religious cult . One worships the killing of babies as Climate control , and the other Worship Climate change to control the ubiquitous mass as preserving life . OXYMORONIC .
What do ‘ pro-life ’ members of Congress have to say about jailing people for self-managing their own abortions ? We asked them . Check out our latest video . Stop Prosecuting Abortion
@RogerHelmerMEP Perhaps the Mirror could campaign to stop abortion so that every little Layton in the womb actually makes it INTO the world !
He will do anything to kill babies . Why does he hate babies so much ? Population control ?
One thing I dislike about my school is the Christian perspective , it is so asinine sometimes it's embarrassing . I'm reading about Christian ethics as it relates to abortion and it says one pov are those who favor " abortion on demand " b / c they believe the fetus is " subhuman " come
@Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately it is evident that nothing will change the minds of most of Trumps base supporters . They dont want to hear the facts - they only selfishly want to see their dream of a pro-life , white society and care less about anything else .

@MariahCBlake @CaitlinPacific @JamesOKeefeIII Not really . He was pretty much dead on on Planned Parenthood . And for the record I am a pro choice democrat .

Yes ! But let's not frame a ban around the idea that they make it harder for individuals who ' agonise ' over a ' very difficult choice ' . Most report feeling relief after an abortion - not regret or sadness . The ' abortion is a difficult decision ' narrative stigmatises abortion .
@itvnews @ABridgen @Jacob_Rees_Mogg That snotty nosed abortion hating ( even though he has shares in an abortion company ) wanker Rees-Mogg is a horrible man . Bridgen is up there with him . Both poor hating gammons that would prefer anyone on less than 40k didn ’ t exist .

@TPRMaynard7 @Rightsatbirth @saturdayobrien Technically a miscarriage is medically called a spontaneous abortion , but most people would think it was insensitive to tell a woman who miscarried that she had a spontaneous abortion . Same with circumcision v amputation .
Fun fact : every time you say “ abortion is murder ” , you ’ re really saying , “ I don ’ t think women should have rights over their own bodies ”

Here is a " good Christian " railing against the darkness of encroaching human rights . Abortion and " the homos " have this man in a state of apoplexy . He's screaming about it , he's so mad at his fellow Christians . Well Christians , does this man stand for what you think is right ?
Catholic social teaching ? Feeding the poor ? Welcoming the refugee ? Fuck that . I'm more concern about my fellow students having sex , forcing them to have a child they dont want / can't afford and then actively opposing domestic policies to support those families Prolife ?
@Liz_Wheeler Funny . I thought @Liz_Wheeler was pro-life until she showed a clip that signals her disapproval of healthcare to people she doesn't like .

- decriminalize sex work ( full decrim ) - abortion on demand - abolish ICE - close all prisons and cages and forced incarceration and containment
Our amendments might fail , but by ramming SB 404 - Parental Consent for Abortion through this Health Policy meeting without incorporating our proposals , Senate Republicans are failing the women of this state . This bill is seriously flawed and curtails reproductive rights
They ’ re sending a clear message that they stand for the slaughter of babies in America . Just sickening .
It's why our ( speaking as someone from the West ) culture can be so incredibly prude often times , to a degree that even negatively inflicts our lives . See abortion debates , see the irrational fear of ' gayness ' , see Janet Jackson's nipplegate . It's ridiculous . But it's our culture .

@Kenzie_Bre @madis__ @baimcpher - also almost all women who know they do not want a baby do take precautions . no one uses abortion as their first choice of birth control . do you even know how expensive it is ? have you even looked at statistics of the women who get abortions ? around 50 % used contraception -

@ibemeubeyou @GraceNGlory4Him @mpj214 @LilaGraceRose @LiveAction Vaccines keep people safe from diseases . Abortion keeps a mother safe from being forced to carry a fetus and give birth . Vaccines keep me from getting deadly diseases . But if theres more anti vaxxers then theres a higher chance that I could get sick
Seems to me that a Judge needs to be removed from the bench and disbarred !
Still simpleia import Muslim refugees and every thing would be destroyed in due course .

Would the universe have existed if humans had not evolved to witness it ? ? A person cannot exist if they don't grow to experience their consciousness . The fact that we are alive doesn't build any case for why abortion should be illegal . Letter To The State

Anecdotal : the level of intense skepticism white anti-choice advocates bring to charter and private schools educating children of color is mind numbing and dispiriting .
@GChristiemd @SpicyMcHaggerty @AP If you actually went to medical school you'd know an abortion is not killing anything . It is the TERMINATION of a PREGNANCY . If you don't like treating patients for the healthcare they need , DON'T BE A DOCTOR .
@justinamash I disagree with you on your abortion rights and healthcare votes . I ’ m not asking you to change your beliefs , but is there a path to agreement between the sides on these two issues that you can see ? Thanks for your time on the question .

@CantBeAskd In nature if Mom can't raise the baby she tosses it to the side of the nest and nature lets it die . It is intentional that babies occasionally die so that the population can sustain even survive . That's true of all species including humans until recent memory . prochoice
@mitchellvii There are tweets I wish Trump had not tweeted , but I still prefer him as he's put many good men and women in positions of power . He's pro-Israel and moved our embassy to Jerusalem . Finally , he's pro-life . He says nonPC things , but he does a great job leading our country .

@madis__ @Kenzie_Bre @baimcpher I'm referring to an embryo . Not a fetus . A fetus is not a cluster of cells , obviously , and also women can't just go and get an abortion at 19 weeks either so your argument is irrelevant to my point . you can't compare terminating a 4-10 week old pregnancy to yours at this stage .
@joewrayforsc @SennSandy In plain English , abortion is “ not ” an issue any state s / b governing ! It “ s / not / be ” interpreted as a crime against a human , since the baby isn ’ t yet a person , until birth ! So , how is it an issue of being a crime against humanity ? It ’ s btwn a mom & dad or mom & priest !

@lokinomics @EquityForward To start : Jewish law allows for abortion , and does not hold that a fetus is a person at conception . For the first 40 days of gestation , a fetus is considered “ mere fluid ” ( Talmud Yevamot 69b ) , and the fetus is regarded as part of the mother for the duration of the pregnancy .
" No one should be considered “ pro-life ” that does not care for a child ’ s well-being or that of their family . "
I agree . And that applies to any current political issue ( inmigration , abortion , vaccines , etc ) . There is no real debate if we don't try to communicate and convice those who believe differently . And that is only is achievable by trying to understand their context and arguments .
@RitaPanahi Many of the supposed pro-choice movement are indeed just abortion fanatics . They truly love abortion . They want it all the way to birth for any reason at all . Fully formed babies . Wow . So yes you are 100 % right to call out their extremism .

It is true that the realities that lead us to abortion are complex . It is not true that this complexity necessitates admitting that a 12 - week fetus has moral and legal standing on par with the woman carrying it . Complexity is not a shield for legalized abuse and misogyny .

You are correct . There ’ s a reason it ’ s the Planned Parenthood aesthetic

@WashTimes I'm a very pro-choice person , and I gotta say : that's actually kinda funny .
Met a 27 y / o black woman that has never had an ob / gyn and has only been to planned parenthood for Pap smears and screenings . At first I was hella judgmental bc like wtf , but then I realized she probably does not have the money to go to see an ob / gyn and that ’ s so unfair

Don ’ t like my ideas ? That ’ s fine . I ’ m sure there are better ones . Go ahead and suggest your own ideas . My point is that it ’ s nonsense to focus on women if you ’ re trying to get rid of abortions . Abortion is the “ cure ” for an unwanted pregnancy .
While actual healthcare providers are losing crucial family planning funds , the Trump-Pence administration is diverting those funds into anti-choice , anti-birth control orgs like Obria Group , which has now been gifted MILLIONS in tax dollars . Protect X
@writermomof4 @rainmc @XplosiveTweets @InjuredAlex @MadamS8N @Sam_DeLoach @LeahNTorres Also I would like to note that you are reading a lot into what I ’ m saying in an effort to make me a villain for helping a pregnant woman who was abused by her spouse & trying to help her find a safe life for herself . Definitely not helping me feel the “ pro-life is love ” cause
@TheTimeTravell3 Nope . I just resent the assertion that abortion is a woman ’ s rights issue when it kills developing girls . Birth control is effective 99 % of the time when taken as directed . You seem to have a problem with women being responsible for their own bodies .
@StudentsforLife Controversial speech also educates . Education before a crisis saves lives and changes one ’ s life trajectory for the better . Those who profit from abortion isolate their victims and call it privacy . Keep saying what you ’ re saying because it makes a “ lively ” difference .
Remember , we are the 7 in 10 pro-choice majority ! We must remain vigilant in our fight to protect Roe and protect our right to decide when to start a family without political interference . ✊ 💜 Pro Choice Protect Roe Stop The Bans

@realDonaldTrump If the Dems wanted a shot at the presidency , they should have made sure they had a Pro-Life candidate . How can someone who loves the God of Israel vote for a Pro-Abortion canadate . Trump is the only option for those who are Prolife
@LeftwardSwing @USARMY04 @AACWrath @ScumBorgSteve @PoliticalOz @JoeBiden It's really easy to decide in 2015 to 2019 all the correct decisions you would have made and have correct positions on issues , much harder to actually have correct positions from 1950 to 2019 .

@chrislhayes It ’ s simple . The GOP thinks a POTUS who brags about sexual assault , commits sexual assault , nominates sexual assailants , tries to ban abortion and is making the country a crappy place for our kids is ok . Maybe they should have listened to and included women ?
The suggestion that abortion in N Ireland would be unregulated if abortion is decriminalised tomorrow is categorically untrue . Guidelines from NICE , medical Royal Colleges , and the significant body of laws governing all medical procedures will regulate services . @BBCr4today

There are just a few exceptions to " late term abortion " .
Former abortion worker describes her boyfriend's devastation over her three abortions
@obianuju Exact quote from the article : “ They ’ re scared about getting pregnant but stop short of asking where and how to get an abortion , because most of them aren ’ t aware that there are free abortion clinics in Nepal . ” Well whose decision was it to have unprotected sex ? The nerve .
A Gestapo state ! ! !
@Smartwoman2019 The schools don ’ t want accountability . They work perfect as they were designed to be . That is the problem . I finally realized this as I , like you , worked toward making our schools better If you support public schools without an option for choice then I feel you are anti education
John @Hickenlooper falling apart . After basically hanging up on a radio host who asked him to give his views on late-term abortion , he's now crying out for the media to " protect him " against an ethics investigation . Not Senator material . cosen copolitics
I WON A PEOPLES CHOICE AWARD AND this is crazy . I mean like seriously . You guys have showed my friends and I so much love and I don ’ t think anything will ever top that and I don ’ t think we ’ ll ever be able to say thank you enough . So here ’ s the first of many ! THANK YOU 😊
Kanye West please don ’ t rail against things like abortion and plan b from your mansion in calabasas . you are out of touch and dangerous . it ’ s ironic when your family also sells a hyper sexualised pornographic version of what a woman is . do not make these people your role models .
@DailyCaller Liberals know no bounds when it commons to incivility and abortion .
Hey . Tell me what you guys think about states deciding whether or not a women is able to have a abortion ?
@xdrfox Yes this is Planned Parenthood building in Houston
@LinsBoon @blu_forest @JoeJenk33482304 @HaydenSanford12 @9Napayshni @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr To be clear , on being married , I meant any man who is against abortion should wait & plan a baby with the mother , or at least find out how she feels on subject . If any doubt , then why is he getting her pregnant ? Many times it's teens who are afraid to tell parents of pregnancy .
@GovMattBevin team has just set up this poster board that reads , “ Only One Candidate will Protect this Child ’ s Life-Matt Bevin America ’ s Most Pro-Life Governor ” @WKYT @FoxLexington
Stating that abortion is murder doesn ’ t equate calling women who have received them murderers . Speaking the truth doesn ’ t mean that we ’ re passing judgment .
@Zer0sion1 Comparing something that is innocent to something extreme . I don't really think that people hating Christmas puts them on the same level as people that hate abortion or gay marriage .

@bnuckols @docobgynmom @QLover18 @AbigailStrom @Groucholiz @DrJenGunter . @bnuckols did I understand . @docobgynmom accurately ? Is she paraphrasing Karl Marx to taint her pro-life critics while she is rationalizing abortion and euthanasia ? And in the process she castigates religious-based health providers ? This Doctor is so obtuse it's mind-boggling .
Honestly , her being a public figure and exposing her opinions and beliefs , I can understand of her being tired of hearing that kind of bull . If you don't agree just don't follow her ( or me for that matter ) , abortion is a matter of public health of a society !

@Bakey_Jo @MaisieBrownJxn I certainly want to see us trying to run candidates that present a real alternative rather than old white men who are anti-choice . I did my duty by voting for Jay made me feel queasy
@TTDerandere Agreed . I think that will fail vis-a-vis first trimester abortion , per Roe v . Wade precedent , though . I think the SCOTUS will likely leave later-term abortion to the states , as is the case now . I also think Kavanaugh will adhere to that precedent , striking the Left dumb .

Why can't Trump supporters see that Russia uses Fox News to spread propaganda ? Donates to Republicans to rule in Russia's favor . Helped install Trump as the final piece to destroy America ? They're so concerned about their guns and who is getting an abortion that they went blind .
Despite Virginia's top three officials being implicated in infanticide , blackface , and sexual assault scandals , Democrats took total control of the state government last night
@Dangchick1 Does anyone know a Trump supporter who does not watch Fox news ? That's the culprit . They are not all raving savage racists . They have been taught to hate socialism and abortion more than the devil .
@jennajameson What in the actual fuck did I just read from planned parenthood twitter ? Am I on another planet ?
Last year at this time , NOBODY foresaw that 2019 would become " The Year of Infanticide . " But as we near the end of the year , we've seen states across the United States propose and enact legislation legalizing third-trimester abortion--and even infanticide !
@DiamondHunter80 @Alyssa_Milano @TrinityResists Backlash grows against VA governor , delegate over late-term abortion bill
@Rewire_News I could care less about this . I care more about the fact that there are millions of families in debt because of medical bills . Y'all need to stop with this abortion thing and focus on universal healthcare .
I could not take anymore of her insane BS . Again , how do we go from talking about children not having medical care and insurance to abortion . 45 followers can't have a normal sane conversation . They gas light you , insult you , and then just keep talking BS until you block them .
Planned Parenthood Made this awesome Office Manager Shouts out to your friends
BUT , the Catholic Church refused to give communion to a person because they are pro-choice .

@scottsauls All the Democrats I ’ ve heard on TV seem to support abortion . As a Christian I cannot support abortion since it ’ s murder . That would be my only argument . Yes , we should be Christians first . I would also never support any Republican who supports abortion .
@Nixflixpix @sdr_medco One word ... Abortion . That's it . As long as Trump continues to cripple access to safe abortions , and stacks the courts until eventually all abortion , even medically necessary , is completely illegal , they will defend every single thing he does .
LMFAO white women are so out of pocket with the shit they ’ re willing to say and put on the Internet . Imagine thinking this was a killer argument AND posting it . Embarrassing .
@glennbeck The infant would be resuscitated , if that ’ s what the mother and the family desires . And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother . Disgusting . ABORTION is legal ABORTION is immoral ABORTION is murder

See what I mean about your strawmen ? I ’ ve explicitly acknowledged that all over the place . But my view has never been that you may never do harm . Something I ’ ve also repeatedly made clear to you . Zero special pleading involved .

@TulsiGabbard So , how are you prepared to show aloha towards Muslims and pro-choice activists ?
@ZubyMusic I definitely fall on the pro-choice side on this one . You have the right to choose abstinence .. you have the right to choose a method of birth control ... You have the right to give an unwanted child up for adoption . You do NOT however have the right to choose to end a life ...
Because that's exactly like abortion 🙄
@NobodybutChelz Abortion isn ’ t an option for all women because not all women agree with it and it ’ s not a decision to be taken lightly . I agree women can be pickier with who they make a baby with but this tweet is hella judgmental and absolves men of everything .
@ewarren Great news . Should we be expecting you to give back money from Planned Parenthood and the Teachers Union ?

@religulous " Abortion " is word that should not even exist . I see nothing wrong in killing those cells if wrongly implanted keep them off earthly sufferings .
Every individual has the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health . UNFPA , together with a wide range of partners , works toward the goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights , including family planning .
We , and countless prolife and prochoice union members will call our legislators TODAY to decry our union leaders ' decision to ditch the little guy and girl . Join us , and call : (617) 722-2396
In order to have informed consent for abortion , women should be told : a ) what the procedure does b ) how it is done c ) the potential risks both physically and mentally d ) risks factors that increase likelihood of risks . e ) what the procedure won't do

@JumpingCactus01 @cattt93 @PPFA 1/2 : Because she's loud and proud about what a great organisation PP is . Planned Parenthood sells aborted fetuses for research purposes . It doesn't inform it's customers , nor does it obtain consent . It lobbied for late term abortions purely to increase profitability .

@MomRovin @IvankaTrump No we need to protect children from irresponsible parents first end abortion then we can talk about the constitutionally protected rights deal ?
Not saying every Josenian has " beliefs " but it has been instilled in us since high school ( or even gradeschool ) to protect " life " at all cost . And by " life " it is directed to the baby , with lesser considerations to the mother . IDK but abortion is still pretty horrifying to me 😔

@MikeB0001 @Stephen92989057 @HanyuuHiiragi @thehill Not sure why you keep bringing up abortion though , a doctor actually has to learn how to do those . So if they haven't then they can't be forced to do them . That being said if they refuse prescribe birth control that's an issue .

@RothAnim Yeah . Okay . That makes sense . I get where you are coming from . I do think an anti-abortion socialist - especially one loudly catholic - could go very , very far . But you might be right that I over-estimate the number of single issue pro life voters

“ There is no ‘ but socialism ’ or ‘ but abortion ’ hiccup that is acceptable . None . Republicans did not say ‘ if we impeach Nixon the commies will roll over us and there will be abortions in the streets . ’ They did their duty before the Constitution . The country eventually agreed . ”

This is an abortion , a violation of civil rights , and now medicine is what the God Almighty Corporation says it is to make money off the backs of their patients . Insurance's job is to pay for what is a reasonable standard of treatment order by a licensed physician , not what some

@evan_carp @BHussler @emrazz No , I ’ d say more men than women appear to support abortion . But if , for example , 6 % of men support abortion because they don ’ t want to pay child support and so think they should get to decide whether or not to terminate , that wouldn ’ t be anti-misogynistic , would it .

@DontTreadOnBaby @Sam_DeLoach It seems like your reply is snark My poorly worded post was an attempt to add a frequent accusation thrown at pro lifers . Along the lines of " you cant be truly prolife life unless you foster / adopt "
never do anything wrong . That ’ s why in Jim Jordan ’ s ProLife ✝ ️ 🤡 🐷 💩 Universe , the FACT that Jim Jordan ignored sexual abuse allegations is “ ridiculous , ” since Nice ProLife ✝ ️ Men like Jim Jordan are incapable of ever doing anything wrong Because they ’ re Such Nice Men .

@heidi_alena @LG4LG @catahoulasrule He was referring to this person who made a big issue because we passed laws against cruelty to animals and still had laws allowing late term abortion .
I am that person . And I ’ m sorry if it shocks some of you . There are valid reasons why some women choose to terminate at 8 months . The fetus may be delivered alive or it may not survive . It is not sick nor evil . These late term terminations are heartbreaking .
This is helpful . Judge blocks rule that denies health services based on moral , religious grounds

Euphemisms are “ foggy words ” . They make you think you know the truth when you don ’ t . Abortion isn ’ t healthcare , or a woman ’ s right , or a blessing ! God ’ s word says that if “ you choose death , it ’ s a curse ” ! Child sacrifice then & now still brings a curse !

@EvanAKilgore @mba382 Misandry ... but what if a man ( who says he's a woman ) happens to believe abortion is the killing of innocent people ? In the case of the Misandrist , does that make the man who says he's a woman a man who should keep his mouth shut or a woman who can have her opinion heard ?
@brhodes Judges . That's their entire reasoning behind this blatant lawlessness . They want a reversal of equal marriage and abortion outlawed and they will destroy this country and themselves in the process to get it . Their hate is stronger than their love of this country .

Abortion is human abuse .
July 2018 - June 2019 there were 17,528 claims from New South Wales and the ACT made under Medicare item 35643 – Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage , that is a first trimester surgical abortion . Source Right to Life .
@PastorLeJohnson @TomBuck I would not completely disagree . I definitely would not equate the two . My point is that in the political realm as a Christian I do believe one must vote the party whose ideology most closely aligns with theirs if not perfectly . Abortion to the extreme is that issue for me .
VOTERS IN AMERICA — Wil CHRISTIAN Democrats go AGAINS ’ T GODs law ! Since DEMO PARTY S U P P O R T S “ ABORTION ” , , & “ PLANNED PARENTHOOD ” , , , If a CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT VOTES 4 ANY DEMO , , They r SUPPORTING MURDER ! A DEMO VOTE , , is a vote 4 MURDERING BABYs , & U are APPROVING IT ! THINK -

@HumanCoalition Every unborn baby is a created , individual masterpiece of God . To kill one of these innocent ones , receives His special attention . God will be busy with the officials of Planned Parenthood on Judgement Day .

It ’ s funny because the pro-life community does more for children in foster care than any other segment of the population . Look it up And is being ripped apart in the womb really preferable to foster care ? Go tell the kids in foster care that .
That anti-abortion man / health official who tracked women and girl ’ s periods in an effort to close Missouri ’ s last abortion clinic is sick . THIS , people , is the face of the anti-choice movement . It ’ s about control and submission .

@Superpaperclip @Heather4amazon @PPact Abortion isn't the only way to prevent parenthood
Absolutely . It ’ s frustrating they get to keep pretending this is about abortion . The Federalist society doesn ’ t care about abortion , they care about installing judges willing to overrule legislators so voters can ’ t displace the powerful . It ’ s a direct attack on democracy .

1 . No one should be nutting in anyone if they dont want kids . 2 . You niggas think having an abortion is a walk in the park yeah . Something you can get over like breaking a nail . No double standards but its better to abort on your own free will

Yes , I disagree with your view on abortion but there are probably 100 things that we would agree on . It's too bad that this conversation has focused on what would divide us . Good luck
the same people agreeing with this are the same people who claim to be pro-life when , in reality , they don ’ t give a shit about kids once they ’ re out of the womb . fuck outta here .
@hollensbe_1 Unless the child is threatening the life of the mother , most abortion patient's needs aren't life-threatening so I don't think a nurse choosing not to assist in an abortion would be detrimental to the patient's care . Other nurses are likely readily available anyway
@realDonaldTrump Sean Spicer is pro-life , will protect your 2A and great with law enforcement and veterans . Other contestants are for open borders and high taxes .
reconcile their feelings with the choice they made and the reasons behind it . having an abortion isn ’ t a “ did it and move on ” thing for everybody . and that experience may not , but can , stay with people in ways they didn ’ t anticipate . there should be room for both .
I think I just get upset , because I feel like there isn't anything I can do besides get in twitter fights lol . I've applied to volunteer at planned parenthood , but never heard anything back

@EdmontonRtb @notabrokenthing @MadamS8N @babygirlbreee @jjflaherty12 @LilaGraceRose And abortion is a guarantee that you won't give birth , and labor and childbirth pose a risk to the life of the pregnant person . No analogy is perfect , and nitpicking the details won't change the logical outcomes of your positions .
5 . And Planned Parenthood and abortions aren ’ t for women who won ’ t use birth control . That ’ s a lie . Birth control fails . Women are raped . Babies have birth defects and women make heartbreaking decisions to have an abortion that they grieve . Women decide they can ’ t afford ..

@FreckledLiberty @5toeGimp @WesOstra I guess it depends on when you think life begins 🤷 🏻 ‍ ♀ ️ I've always understood libertarianism to mean pro-everything . Pro-gun , pro-choice , pro-weed , etc . But there could be different types of libertarianism . As long as you agree that being pro-choice isnt less libertarian either ♡

Abortion certainly hasn't been " safe " for the millions of children it's killed . Interested to know what " evidence-based research " has been more influential in your formation than reconstructing a fetus ' body to make sure you've plucked her completely from her mother's uterus .
Christine Blasey Ford trying to destroy a man ’ s life , slandering him as a rapist w / ZERO evidence , in order to save Abortion ( her attorneys own words ) , takes about as much courage as getting on your knees for or in bed with , a married guy named Willie , to advance your career .

@KAG202006351826 The info they gathered was FAKED too . I know you're new to this trolling thing and that was a good effort to deflect from the facts but still terrible . For those who are reading this thread here are the facts and do your own homework please :
Planned Parenthood is evil . Look at the nefarious use of quotations to say sex means different things to different people .

This is a religious belief not a scientific one . But even so the Bible says life begins at first breath in multiple places , features an abortion ritual , and refers to a fetus as property
personal and possibly moral / ethical beliefs ? Certain groups such as Planned Parenthood argued : " the rule would allow for discrimination in the name of religious freedom . " What a crock of crap . The doctors take the Hippocratic oath to " Save Lives , " not " Kill Them ! ! "
@EzraCeleste We ’ ll debate about abortion in front of everyone and it will be glorious . Also , I don ’ t see you coming up with solutions here !
@LeadStoriesCom Abortion has long been a key component of population control measures . See China and India for example . China is obviously the most notorious advocate of abortion as a means of population control .

Question for y ’ all to ponder : Is @Alyssa_Milano still leading the “ sex strike ” so she can have access to an “ abortion ” 🤔 If so , that pairs nicely with No Nut Novermber It ’ s been determined libtards shouldn ’ t breed .

@SeptembersRain choice . If people WANT to get vaccinated , that's their choice . Similarly , if a person doesn't want to get vaccinated , that's their choice . Anti-vaxxers are AGAINST gov't mandates and FOR informed consent and choice .

@Hatewatch @UR_Ninja Brett Kavanaugh's ascension to SCOTUS signaled to anti-choicers that the time was now to pass abortion bans . This piece from @Wonkette undercuts the claims that such bans are being enacted in good faith :
Barrett posted this photo on IG explaining what an abortion really is , and how being anti-abortion doesn't make you pro-life and not having the choice of abortion can be prejudicial to a child .
Let's expose the hospital authority ! Sen @MarshaBlackburn needs 2 know a teenage female protester was in @hkpoliceforce custody & was raped by 4 cops . She was pregnant & just had an abortion . The story got leaked 2 public . 🇭 🇰 IPCC hires Int'l experts . Now the doctor is threatened .
