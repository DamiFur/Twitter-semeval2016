Bailey , people who have made their own informed decisions are not insane . They are educated . Sincerely , a sane , pro-choice mother .
This is the saddest situation , I ‚Äô m so ashamed of it . It seems as if it ‚Äô s just one of the things that ‚Äô s happened that nobody cares about . It ‚Äô s like the abortion rate it gets greater and greater and nobody says anything , like no one wants to stand up and say this is got to STOP .
@alanspade @W_Jamie @BGPolitics @AndyBeshearKY It's a part of it sure . The economy would be the biggest issue for GOP voters and the working class in my opinion . We're a solid pro-life state , there's not a single law that denies civil rights to those folks that's been passed , and Donald Trump is a national concern .
This is basically it in a nutshell , then add the Russian collusion thing , and the blackmail ...
@learning2fly6 @alvedaking I disagree , it is not God's Will to rape or commit incest , that is a choice the offending individual makes against God's Will . The consequences carries pain and hardships . I cannot condemn a rape or incest victim for choosing abortion provided the abortion occurs before Pain .

@jperky1956 I think that is a woman's right say " Yes " or " No " when she is asked if she wants to have sex . If a woman is raped thus deprived of the ability to say " No " , that situation is different and an abortion within 2 weeks or so is Okay . Nobody should kill a baby for any other reason .
The roundabout by the Eureka branch of Planned Parenthood is not hard to navigate yet most can ‚Äô t .
@FoxPrintsArt @HumphreyBarry @NARAL @MattBevin Pro-choice are NOT pro abortion ? then what are they ? What about the rights of the little woman in the womb ? do they have NO rights ? Making abortion illegal makes it more dangerous ? for who ? the mother who wants to kill her baby ? disgusting !
Mi pare tutto coerente no ?
@IGN
... because that'd just have been too awkward to tell these women to change their " favourite woman " on a poster . Which is more important than making Jewish people feel safe or not upholding things like forced conversions or pro-life beliefs ?

@Tgdraw @peytnhaag no one is pro-abortion . its called pro-choice for a reason . their body , their choice . you dont have to get an abortion if you dont want to , but dont tell someone what they can or cant do with their body . not everyone is financially , physically , or even mentally ready for a child .
If you ‚Äô re anti-abortion and the GOP won ‚Äô t have you , go change the GOP ! Or consider whether it MIGHT JUST MIGHT be that anti-abortion politics are specifically about the oppression of marginalized people and that there ‚Äô s a reason Dems aren ‚Äô t willing to budge on that one .
@RRosalski @jmcappiello I don't eat animals but many animal campaigners do , I see your point .

@reawakened_m That's the sad thing . I think even a little goes a long way and as long as there is the option of medical abortion it will help a great deal . Afger that a person can receive proper education and support to avoid it in the future . You never know they can teach & help others later

They ‚Äô re sending a clear message that they stand for the slaughter of babies in America . Just sickening .
It's why our ( speaking as someone from the West ) culture can be so incredibly prude often times , to a degree that even negatively inflicts our lives . See abortion debates , see the irrational fear of ' gayness ' , see Janet Jackson's nipplegate . It's ridiculous . But it's our culture .

@homebody315 @haverscutie1 @winsprig @TurnoutPAC Linda , you are preaching about our President ‚Äô s sins but yet you beg Michelle Obama to run for President . Do you know that she is a huge supporter of abortion-killing babies ? ? ? She is a huge supporter of same sex marriage.Both go against Biblical teachings.Your hypocrisy is showing
@LifeNewsHQ saying you know your " choice " will end a human life and you accept all responsibility now and unto eternity for that choice . Oh , and  4 you have to pay for your abortion . No taxpayer money . If you aren't willing to do these 4 things you need to seriously re-think that choice .

@trevorsookraj @Medium Which part / idea do you disagree with ? Evangelical Christianity is really tightly woven into the American political landscape - it ‚Äô s pretty terrifying the way it affects things that are more clear cut in places where there is more separation .

@emilyslist Abortion stops a beating heart . It ‚Äô s murder and I will do everything in my power to elect public officials who will ban it without exception . Abortion is never medically necessary . Dealing with an ectopic pregnancy or other similar issues is not abortion .

@StevenErtelt I could beleive that better if @POTUS would just write an Executive Order mandating that abortions are illegal , then stand with Pro Life as it gets contested before the SCOTUS , Roe V Wade can be reversed if we prove an embryo has an innate destiny to become human ! quote @AP RT
@TeeKayZim @ZiFMStereo Problem the rule on abortion World over has been made by people 1 . Who don't have a uterus and 2 . Who will never get pregnant 3 . The same people responsible for rape and selling pads are the same legislators of abortion World over . Just those three facts should answer you .
@Kenzie_Bre @madis__ @baimcpher - also almost all women who know they do not want a baby do take precautions . no one uses abortion as their first choice of birth control . do you even know how expensive it is ? have you even looked at statistics of the women who get abortions ? around 50 % used contraception -
First it ‚Äô s no for abortion then this ? Y ‚Äô all are weird as fuck .
@13fingerfx And would such rapture from the womb count as an abortion ?
@RutiRegan @slooterman This .

@GChristiemd @SpicyMcHaggerty @AP If you actually went to medical school you'd know an abortion is not killing anything . It is the TERMINATION of a PREGNANCY . If you don't like treating patients for the healthcare they need , DON'T BE A DOCTOR .

@madis__ @Kenzie_Bre @baimcpher I'm referring to an embryo . Not a fetus . A fetus is not a cluster of cells , obviously , and also women can't just go and get an abortion at 19 weeks either so your argument is irrelevant to my point . you can't compare terminating a 4-10 week old pregnancy to yours at this stage .
@joewrayforsc @SennSandy In plain English , abortion is ‚Äú not ‚Äù an issue any state s / b governing !

@lokinomics @EquityForward To start : Jewish law allows for abortion , and does not hold that a fetus is a person at conception . For the first 40 days of gestation , a fetus is considered ‚Äú mere fluid ‚Äù ( Talmud Yevamot 69b ) , and the fetus is regarded as part of the mother for the duration of the pregnancy .
" No one should be considered ‚Äú pro-life ‚Äù that does not care for a child ‚Äô s well-being or that of their family . "
I agree . And that applies to any current political issue ( inmigration , abortion , vaccines , etc ) . There is no real debate if we don't try to communicate and convice those who believe differently . And that is only is achievable by trying to understand their context and arguments .
@RitaPanahi Many of the supposed pro-choice movement are indeed just abortion fanatics . They truly love abortion . They want it all the way to birth for any reason at all . Fully formed babies . Wow . So yes you are 100 % right to call out their extremism .

Don ‚Äô t like my ideas ? That ‚Äô s fine . I ‚Äô m sure there are better ones . Go ahead and suggest your own ideas . My point is that it ‚Äô s nonsense to focus on women if you ‚Äô re trying to get rid of abortions . Abortion is the ‚Äú cure ‚Äù for an unwanted pregnancy .
While actual healthcare providers are losing crucial family planning funds , the Trump-Pence administration is diverting those funds into anti-choice , anti-birth control orgs like Obria Group , which has now been gifted MILLIONS in tax dollars . Protect X

@TheTimeTravell3 Nope . I just resent the assertion that abortion is a woman ‚Äô s rights issue when it kills developing girls . Birth control is effective 99 % of the time when taken as directed . You seem to have a problem with women being responsible for their own bodies .
@StudentsforLife Controversial speech also educates . Education before a crisis saves lives and changes one ‚Äô s life trajectory for the better . Those who profit from abortion isolate their victims and call it privacy . Keep saying what you ‚Äô re saying because it makes a ‚Äú lively ‚Äù difference .
Remember , we are the 7 in 10 pro-choice majority ! We must remain vigilant in our fight to protect Roe and protect our right to decide when to start a family without political interference . ‚úä üíú Pro Choice Protect Roe Stop The Bans

@tc_emdee @BornTheBondGir1 @Tzipshmil @balupuppy @mattyglesias @clairecmc Would you prefer that I link to polling data on abortion in Missouri , Indiana , Iowa et al ? Or are we literally going to pretend the majority ( and ethically correct ) pro-choice views of the country at large are what we ‚Äô re discussing here . Because there ‚Äô s a term for the latter .
Sexual predators like Planned Parenthood too .
Really important and interesting question . Several put to me by other organisations we work with recently include : separation of baby from mother , certain genetic screening / abortion , very early years childcare . Interestingly often around lack of knowledge on very young babies .

@StefanMolyneux The need to appeal to female viewers , liberal media , metoo , abortion , the loss of the family unit ; they're all related .
Paul Henderson has repeatedly defamed me ( and all PPCers ) by insinuating we were Nazis and that I ( and all who are pro-life ) are misogynists . Black Press and the local Chilliwack Progress is shockingly biased . I am very sorry that Alan Forsythe was fired . It is all pretty absurd .

@mikeallstevens I wish I had asked the guy about late term abortion , instead of focusing on the funding issue . But I dont know if it would have mattered . They are heartless . I joke about not caring if they extinct themselves but it's more complicated than that . They cant just murder babies .

@KeithMillsD7 I don't know how the pro-life side could've played this any other way . Apart from defending the right to be born , they had to defend themselves against smears & lies also as well as being up against practically every political party & media outlet .
@RashaanB310 @thor_benson @johniadarola To some extent , yes , but it is important to understand that many of these evangelicals are basically single-issue voters . Reps have been taking advantage of this for decades . I think they will ignore almost anything as long as the a candidate supports anti-abortion policy .
@MeleMallory @jgeigerselva @cmclymer @DonaldTrump Here's my take . Racism is bad . Personal responsibility is good . Abortion is murder . Religion is sacred , yes including all religions . Respect for law enforcement and the military . Helping your neighbors . And , ditching political correctness and the " woke " mentality .

Sexual and reproductive health is very much a basic right , especially for women . If women do not have rights over their body and sexuality , if women do not get proper health services throughout their lives , they will not be able to live and function in a dignified way .

@religulous " Abortion " is word that should not even exist . I see nothing wrong in killing those cells if wrongly implanted keep them off earthly sufferings .
Every individual has the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health . UNFPA , together with a wide range of partners , works toward the goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights , including family planning .
We , and countless prolife and prochoice union members will call our legislators TODAY to decry our union leaders ' decision to ditch the little guy and girl . Join us , and call : (617) 722-2396
In order to have informed consent for abortion , women should be told : a ) what the procedure does b ) how it is done c ) the potential risks both physically and mentally d ) risks factors that increase likelihood of risks . e ) what the procedure won't do

Planned Parenthood Almost Sold Her an Abortion , But She Changed Her Mind . Now Her Son is 10 BEAUTIFUL STORY !

The only for sure exception to abortion for me is life of the mother .
@evan_carp @BHussler @emrazz No , I ‚Äô d say more men than women appear to support abortion . But if , for example , 6 % of men support abortion because they don ‚Äô t want to pay child support and so think they should get to decide whether or not to terminate , that wouldn ‚Äô t be anti-misogynistic , would it .
The Ohio Senate passed two anti-abortion bills Wednesday , including one that would require physicians to notify patients that an abortion can be reversed - - a procedure that hasn ‚Äô t been scientifically proven .

@bantam_polly @neithskye In case you're asking for real ... no . They are one that thinks abortion should be outlawed because it's what adoption is for .
Yes , this is the reason . Not the blind , unthinking allegiance to abortion that results in visceral demonization of its opponents . Not fifty years of treating the pro-choice position as some sort of obscene religious tenet for radical feminists . No , our rhetoric is the reason .

@PastorLeJohnson @TomBuck I would not completely disagree . I definitely would not equate the two . My point is that in the political realm as a Christian I do believe one must vote the party whose ideology most closely aligns with theirs if not perfectly . Abortion to the extreme is that issue for me .

@HuffPost Yes , we need to keep options open to women because they can not make rational decisions like , " Should I have sex ? , or " Should I use birth control " etc .

@ScientiaPercept @AGTCnews In the case of Planned Parenthood v . Rounds (8 th Cir . 2008 ) , the United States Court of Appeals found as a matter of fact that a human being is a member of the human species . Simply , you do not believe that all human beings should be protected by the law .

Abortion certainly hasn't been " safe " for the millions of children it's killed . Interested to know what " evidence-based research " has been more influential in your formation than reconstructing a fetus ' body to make sure you've plucked her completely from her mother's uterus .
Christine Blasey Ford trying to destroy a man ‚Äô s life , slandering him as a rapist w / ZERO evidence , in order to save Abortion ( her attorneys own words ) , takes about as much courage as getting on your knees for or in bed with , a married guy named Willie , to advance your career .
