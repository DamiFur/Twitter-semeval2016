Former abortionist : Horror of abortion is ‚Äò exactly what the pictures show ‚Äô
Doctors must report to authorities when they suspect a women has intentionally interrupted pregnancy . Penalizing of abortion is 2-8 years but the women who have been reported to authorities have been charged for aggravated homicide , sentenced to 30-40 years in prison .
If you think only those who have or can get pregnant can have an opinion about abortion , you're not really pro-choice as much as you are pro-abortion . And did you just assume gender ? prochoice proabortion prolife
@1SillyBlondegir @Wells_InThe_360 @EastBayTroy @JeffInNorco @BrianInBugaha Wells should turn Democrat and have planned parenthood help him decide his kid's future , Right ?

@FredRevived @Sequoia_Red @Aly_Dar8 @MadamS8N @InjuredAlex @LeahNTorres It is because the deciding factor is based on nothing other than an assessment of the pregnant person's ' guilt ' or innocence .

@Cursed_Pics @ohsdeux @zygote_a @dessikitty @RightAllTheTime @that1mum ( 1 ) If a women wants to have an abortion she can only do it for so long , if she waits too long it becomes illegal since too much has already been developed . Women miscarry more often than you may think . You can get pregnant on and miscarry on your own . Miscarrying usually results
It ‚Äô s the pro-choice indoctrination . They start telling girls in high school that they exclusively own their vaginas , then in college they really beat down on it ! That ‚Äô s how the DNC keeps its stranglehold in America , by getting the vast majority of women to vote for their vaginas .

" ... reproductive rights advocates say that there is no evidence of the practice happening in the United States and that the ban plays on racial stereotypes and has discriminatory medical effects that could result in restricting access to abortion . "
@skanz0 @giant_brain Only if it ‚Äô s forced hun . If a woman chooses abortion of her own free will and consent it isn ‚Äô t a violation . Pregnancy violates females bodies , where do you stand on that ?

@jtomka @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Hmmm ... I'm glad yoi got paid what you thought you were worth but data stats and science doesn't back your claim . A women should be able to decide whether she wants a baby or not . If you dont want an abortion-it's simple dont get one . End of discussion .

As the @USCCB embarks on a well-intentioned year of accompanying and supporting women in crises pregnancies , I hope they will keep in mind the reasons why women actually have abortions , which are rarely sympathetically presented by pro-life propaganda :
@YahayaRamadan4 @Animashaun_ The hanafiyyah , Ar-ramliy , and Ibn wahbaan , are few of the scholars who credited permission for abortion . The conditions being that it must be in the first forty days , when it poses serious threats to the life of the woman carrying it . Others may include rape and Zina .

@SW4ChoiceNZ Tautoko . I think often people assume that their pro-choice friends may not have experienced the loss of a wanted pregnancy , and that assumption helps no one . Especially because we know that one of the biggest demographics of people seeking abortion already have children .

Sad time to be living in where " stop shooting our kids " is seen as a " liberal talking point " by the " pro-life " crowd ...
You can hate Trump forbeing pro-life not killing babies except to save the life of the mother / incest , & defunding planned parenthood , but he's saving countless babies from being murdered because the public was lied to about babies being a blob of tissue and selling baby parts !

Missouri Could Become the First State in the Nation Without an Abortion Clinic . What Happens Next ?
Agreed , but the ‚Äú silent majority ‚Äù wasn ‚Äô t so silent , almost two thirds of Canadians voted for Parties with a serious climate change plan and with a clear position on LGBTQ + and women ‚Äô s reproductive rights 60 % of voters vote for policies , 20 % for Leaders , do the math
@ConradkBarwa @buildmoretrams Yes , but there is better sense in US that the sphere of politics & religions are separate , dosent always work in practice ( abortion etc ) but religion is not used for official persecution . Like Tocqueville said , in US liberty and faith are not opposed ( unlike what he saw in Europe )
@fosterhazziezjr @SamuelLozado @radmarryjay @jazziesavage_ @DebBruh I agree but at the end of the day if a women wants an abortion and the man doesn ‚Äô t , she should be able to have an abortion and if the women wants to keep the baby and the man doesn ‚Äô t then she should be able to keep the baby . Men can have an opinion , just not the final say .
" Planned Parenthood isn't about healthcare . It's about abortion . " - Rep . Chip Roy ( R-TX )
@pellbabe @MattWalshBlog I think we'll have to agree to disagree about this issue . Abortion is a dead issue . The Supreme Court ruled on it decades ago , and arguing about it today is a waste of your time .
people are getting pressed about the " all men are trash " statement huh . like women weren't oppressed by men by not being allowed to vote or taking away women's reproductive rights

A federal judge blocked Alabama ‚Äô s controversial abortion law today . The law banned abortions during every stage of pregnancy ( except if the mother ‚Äô s life was at risk ) . It would have taken effect Nov 15th . Similar laws have been blocked in Georgia , Missouri , Mississippi & Kentucky
Hasta donde son capaces los d Planned Parenthood ? reportedly tells mother : We will ' break the baby's neck ' if he's born alive " Nosotros romperemos el cuello del beb√© si es q √©l nace vivo " Es imposible tener alma para decir algo as√≠ . Para ellos el bb es solo la mercanc√≠as .
@johniadarola 1 . Praise " The Squad " ( genuinely ) , 2 . Praise Obama , 3 . Admit being wrong about climate change or border security and publicly apologise , 4 . Get legislation passed to legalise abortion / gay marriage and claim responsibility ... lots of things
@TeeKayZim @ZiFMStereo Abortion is killing someone who has no choice . What if we could wait and ask them ( the baby ) to kill them ( take away its life ) because they were a mistake . I wonder what they would ( the baby ) say .

@jasonebeling found pro-life @bnuckols w expertise : Women who don't want to be pregnant & men who don't want to get someone pregnant , must personally , responsibly * plan * to prevent the union of sperm & oocyte by abstinence , sterilisation , or 2 forms of non-abortifascient contraception .
Democrats are the party of past slavery , current economical slavery . The party of pro-abortion , pro-illegal immigrants , pro-Gun Confiscation , pro-tax , pro-elitism . Since Hillary , they hate the Electoral college , ignore the rule of law & a danger to our Constitution .
I am absolutely against abortion personally unless it endangers the mother ‚Äô s life or a product of rape and incest , however i am pro-choice , i believe it should be a decision that the mother should make and government should not implement laws to curtail that freedom .

@GailRule1 @DMMJ314 And that's where we disagree . Keep in mind again that as someone who battled infertility , I don't like abortion at all . I only think it must be legal and safe and think that my opinions on the matter cannot be imposed on someone else .
It ‚Äô s hella annoying that you can joke about everything under the fucking sun even taking it as far as rape and abortion , but let somebody say one thing about the LGBT community and y ‚Äô all ready to go to war ? ? ? Lmfao um ok ...

Seeing these abortion protests at my school got me thinking : where my pro-abortioners at ? Kill The Kids
Ok seriously WTF : Planned Parenthood says " virginity is a made-up social construct " via @DisrnNews
I've done about anything you can think of except murder . Unless you consider abortion murder . If so , then I've done murder . A few years back I took care of my newborn great grandson for a full year , 12 hours a day . But now I'm tired . My doc says I'm depressed . But I wonder . 4/6

No . Next question .
@JuddApatow That Republicans don't practice what The Bible teaches escapes Red voters . In part due to the very specific battles ( abortion , etc ) conservative leadership chooses to fight . And fear .

Appeal it ! ! !

@ExistentialIzzy But I'm also a fundy Christian , pro-life advocate , believe in small government and states rights , complementarianism , free speech , personal responsibility , etc . So liberals think I'm a conservative .
