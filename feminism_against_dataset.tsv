The #WomensMarch2020 is NOT pro-women nor will it ever speak for all women . I have been pushed , cussed out , screamed at , and even spit on simply for attending as a Conservative woman . Feminists do not support all women and that is why so many rightfully reject it .
@AryanmittalMRA @OfficeOfKNath @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @YouTube @Twitter @myogiadityanath @Dev_Fadnavis @BJP4India @rashtrapatibhvn Yes , it should have been tax free
@JuliaHB1 Its the feminists and the liberal media who's to blame too for those poor girls .
@ugtunga That's a wonderful family ‚ù§ Ô∏è ‚ù§ Ô∏è ‚ô• Ô∏è ... It's only possible wherein the Devoted mother lavishly keeps praising the Dad , for the heaps of love she continues to endure from her Hubby ... Awww ... God bless .. ‚ù§ Ô∏è ‚ù§ Ô∏è ‚ô• Ô∏è Don't let LUNATIC FEMINISTS to gain any access .
On Fox News tonight , they talked about Harry pimping on Meghan's behalf to land her a gig at Disney . Because she's a feminist and doesn't need men to help her . And an actress who can get hired by her limitless talent . And a duchess because she respects the Royal Family so much .
@marstrina Yes , I don't fancy it at all . I think it looks twee . And a bit ' this is for the feminists . ' Nah .
In Ghana here , what have feminists done for women . Except tell you ladies to post naked online

@DavidRutz @politicalelle Im starting to think that #matthewdowd is a misogynist .
Oh man ... and here I thought the war on women wasn ‚Äô t left or right ... in fact misogyny transcended it . I didn ‚Äô t realise that to be a feminist required you to be ideologically pure as well . And this is from the left . Jesus , ladies ... don ‚Äô t do this .
@MichaelRosenYes @eoghandotio @anna_carlile @GoldsmithsUoL @SarahHaggerHolt @DrCAButler @LGBTQ_Centre @EducateCelebrat @stonewalluk If so , @MichaelRosenYes , why the title about ‚Äú queering ‚Äù ? Many feminists and lesbians do not support the word or concept here . I hope you invite perspectives from @AllianceLGB @SafeSchools_UK @Transgendertrd and allow open discussion

feminists who see how language regarding the female body is being erased , how rape and death threats are abundant , how trans people are petitioned to be prioritized in detention centers ...
@mezakrp @Jewellmb I guess we will not find a real consent but for me it was an interesting discussion and thank you for the recommendations .

More power to Kangana Ranaut , the true icon of feminism , unapologetic patriot and one of the few voices of reason in Bollywood . Unlike dynasts who've had everything handed to them on a silver platter , she's a self-made woman who has worked her way to the top . Full support to her .
Radical feminists should all be shipped to Islam to endure Sharia law . Then let them come back and tweet about toxic masculinity and how victimized they are .
@SpurtyRao @JyotiSNK Kanyadaan is one of the best thing for a Hindu .. it is like giving a precious treasure to a suitable person .. A daughter raised in dharmik way is progenitor of a heroic race , a lifelong guide and guard to her husband and his kula and a pride for parents . Feminazis won't get this
@amaryllisalpha @namomnetempus Yep . As do a number of women I view as strong feminists . Look at Janey Godley . She's totally TWAW . But she's no walkover ! So I wonder what are the factors coming together that make strong , perceptive women believe this ? It's probably a number of things .
@_samisaviv @samstevensmusi1 @_AndreaUrbanFoX Unbelievable . He ‚Äô s the misogynist abusing women isn ‚Äô t he ?

@amaryllisalpha @namomnetempus Time being seems to be saying that simply having gender dysphoria equates to you being a misogynist . That trans women per se are misogynistic merely by fact of being trans women .
@MhairiHunter @SNPChris @Sinead1988 You know not everyone who doesn ‚Äô t identify with the gender stereotypes of their birth sex wants to be asked on a form whether they do or don ‚Äô t , right ? Rather than just asked the basic fact of their sex . Because it ‚Äô s a nonsense question .

@trumpwarrior45 The primary should be on 1 day country wide , like the actual election

@MarkPl08 he was one of these anti-gamergate types who called everyone and everything a " misogynist " , but eventually would not concede to the transactivists
How can men cooperate with women to achieve equality if " men are the enemy " . How do you expect support from men for your cause while demonising " all men " . It's like modern feminism doesnt wanna solve problems , just start pointless arguments

@JeanHatchet Yep . Women bang on about something for years but until a man starts talking about it , no one notices . Shouting into the void that is the patriarchy . ' Why aren't feminists talking about this ? ' - WE ARE - WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING ! ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
I find it interesting that when masculine women ( & let's be honest this is usually aimed at lesbians specifically , not queer women generally ) are misogynistic ppl tend to blame their masculinity but when " femmes " do the exact same thing it's internalized misogyny .. why is that ?
@drlouisejmoody Wow , racism , sexism , homophobia , ethnic and religious prejudice and anti-semitism in one tweet . It ‚Äô s gotta be some kind of record .
@stillbelIa @Rainbow1Dashie @WomenReadWomen @stillbeIla @workthewind It's offensive because it implies we identify into a gender and therefore into the oppression that women and girls have endured for millennia . Girls can't identify out of FGM , or child marriage . I don't believe in gender . It's a set of stereotypes that is harmful to everyone .
Feminist : All men are responsible for the bad actions of some men ! Me : Women are responsible for their own bad actions.Feminist : YOU JUST HATE WOMEN !
@GabeTheDeadFish @babybeginner @r_missus This conversation went into the weeds fast . It started with the assumption that when 2 men came into a unisex bathroom , the daughter was magically harmed and traumatized.Then someone said that MEN are doing this . Which is wrong because it's intersectional feminists that push it

I blame feminism for all the bread that goes to waste at my house .
@waters_glow @knownheretic Gender stereotypes and sexuality are not the same thing . In fact sexuality often flies in the face of gender identity . Gender is imposed on us by a controlling patriarchy , sexuality is real and not ‚Äú chosen ‚Äù . It seems hard for many people to separate these two which is problematic
Excuse me , " fighting for women _in spite of themselves _ " ? Did I really just read one of the most misogynistic , patronizing things someone could say ? Eee-Yuck !

@PalatineSteve @abbiemalfoyy @matt8284 @TheLondonHughes Oh well , it doesn't really matter if you're male or white , sexism and racism aren't really taken seriously if that's the case . So much for privilege .

@monaeltahawy @Glinner If it wasn't for @Glinner I wouldn't have a clue about the misogyny that is being perpetrated against women every day in this ' war ' . When the rest of society becomes aware of this tete-a-tete they are really going to take a dim view of the behaviour of some trans activists .
@mareile_s @knownheretic @TooOld4ThisShyt @BBCFactualPR @stephenfry @BBCOne @NHM_London Transwomen face judgement for not fitting into society's gender-stereotypes , stereotypes feminism has been trying to break us out of . They generally face this from males . It's not misogyny , per se .
.. forced income equality vs equality of opportunity , identity politics , radical gender ideology , intersectionality , toxic masculinity , multiculturalism , white privilege , reparations , cultural appropriation and patriarchy .
@Fuckiiit @Marle68913303 @suelane2009 @Glinner Misogynist you certainly are .

@ElephantAudrey Theyre not a majority by any means.One thing I try to do with the others is refuse to descend to their level.Someone once advised me when dealing with feminists , be polite and treat them like members of any other hate movement . Bit extreme but I get the point .
@kellyfairchild2 @_seokwoo Nope , only someone with any understanding of equality would see the Orwellian Animal Farm " equality " that feminism pushes as misandry.Because it is.Feminism is by definition sexism , egalitarianism is equality .
Thanks for the incitement Rogaine Ogre , the failure to charge the Ogre for incitement local police , and the failure to ban the Ogre for incitement , all of legacy and social media ! You can tell who the female people are by how easy it is to get away with threatening them !

Feminists will never call out Australian Muslim Men for their misogyny . Let's face it , why would they , they don't want to be stabbed , beaten , subjugated , raped or sold off as sex slaves under their islamic culture and law.Plus they both have Marxism in common.Bacon anyone ?

@ratinannelynne @MayorWatermelon @oremlares If I wasn't socialized as F I sure suffered through a whole lot of nothing in particular .

@Judith_Char @gayle_mccreanor Feminism covers a broad range of fields of study . Like Cordelia Fine , who writes about neuroscience , for instance.If you like I could recommend some books . Feminism does actually mean something and it's been hijacked deliberately.https :/ / t.co/qU7sYqW2sa
I ‚Äô m checking out of #Feminism . I want equality for ALL women , I regularly campaign for women ‚Äô s reproductive rights & body autonomy . Yet for some reason this no longer aligns with modern feminism . I get more abuse from feminists than I do from right wing groups . It ‚Äô s a toxic space
Whether you love or hate critical Theory ( Critical Race Theory , intersectionality , third wave feminism , etc . ) , I think you have to admit that the behaviour of most of its adherents , when faced with criticism , is absolutely extraordinary . Thread .
@monaeltahawy No such thing as a pro trans activist feminist . Trans activists are male rights activists .
Piers Morgan is an obsessed bully . There is a small , angry minority on Twitter ardently supportive , & nearly all of them has a timeline filled with racism , Brexit fury , misogyny & xenophobia .

The defense of child sex bots as prevention of pedophilia is the same used to defend the sex industry : men can't help themselves and are entitled to fulfill their desires at any cost to women and children . Feminism means expecting men to be accountable for their desire to harm .
@oscarandjeeves @GabeTheDeadFish @HoneyBadgerBite So far sounds good.Here is my problem : I have seen what feminism does and how men and children are treated by it and there is no middle ground in feminism for me .

@45is50 @justjueli @YYataxxx @LailaMickelwait I think we DO agree on keeping young people away from violent porn , or even porn in general , but the problem with feminists is that you're refusing to deal in facts and truths , so it's very hard to find consensus and move forward . It's very sad actually.Either way , take care .
@emmazingt_ @Yvnq_C No I respect women . But unlike many today I also respect men and see the bias in today's society.To quote a feministEquality seems like oppression to the oppressor . In case you don't get it I see feminists as oppressors .

@Slippth0t The sad thing being that in most of those cases , the thing they sought wasn't being denied to them because of sexism , sometimes men just want to enjoy things with other men . Feminism hates that , despite women having the same power throughout all of history , for their interests .

@czarevna_panda @JimJatras @Jay_D007 @therealMedWhite @JoeTM_SA @matushkasmomcat Yes , feminism is directly from Satan , because it contradicts the hierarchy of authority among the sexes which is God-ordained ( according to St .

Going to start praying for these people instead of being mad at them . It ‚Äô s easy to see why and how they all gravitate toward the Dem Party .

@grain99806254 @JenniferAnne_s @JetSkiBum01 @MatterStill @GoodLifeFitness Again . Gender is not a thing . Gender is sex stereotypes . That ‚Äô s it.Woman is not a gender , it ‚Äô s a developmental category for human females . You can ‚Äô t ID into it . It ‚Äô s an exclusive category . It excludes infant and juvenile females and literally all males .

@djbirkinshaw @MichaelRosenYes " TERF " is misogynistic hate speech , aimed at bullying women perceived as the wrong kind of feminist into silence . I am a man and therefore cannot be a feminist . Try better .

@GiftD_artiste @mikey_esquire @RationalMale @honestmisogyny You notice its only women / feminists co-signing this pathetic bit of pandering for female brownie points ... If women feel self-rightous & arrogant enough to tell us " what a ' real man's is , " then men have every right to speak on abuse.GTFOOHWTBS
They will continue to act as if woman = female is a WHITE thing . ITS . NOT . WHITE SUPREMACY is pretending as if we don't know of the two sexes , w / out whites . WHITE supremacy is PRETENDING we NEED white women to INCLUDE Us in feminism , SIMPLY reducing us to reacting to some racism .
Does it hurt that a woman of colour called you out on your white privilege ? It must do given the amount of whining you ‚Äô re doing on twitter today . You ‚Äô ve a racism & sexism problem.These idiots can ‚Äô t even play by their own woke rules . https://t.co/kZzXEYwmuR
In Iran , feminists cheer as women defy the regime.By contrast in the UK , when heroic Iranian feminists like @MaryamNamazie come to speak at unis , ‚Äò progressive ‚Äô students try to get them banned , and mobs stand up in the middle of their talks and scream abuse at them . For shame .

@MichaelRosenYes Children don't need adults telling them that the way they feel ( or * are * ) is ' queer ' when it doesn't conform to gender stereotypes , or might even mean they have the wrong body .

@adamgreeney @irishlovemonkey @patriotmckenzie There are a lot of examples of men discriminating against groups of men perceived to be harmful to women . Like not hiring bachelors during the great depression . Again , if someone is motivated by " feminism " to do something bad ... does that make feminism toxic ?
Transactivism is increasingly unpopular , not because people hate trans people , but because its demands are unreasonable , misogynist , homophobic and harmful to children .
@NSchneiderAZ13 @Glinner It's not .

@LanaLacious @juliaioffe To take this absolute shitty approach and suggest that all of society needs to now bend and act in accordance to it is insane ( as was the MeToo movement ) . It might make sense , if women never lie . Which is absurd . Even a feminist could claim this with a straight face .

You underestimate the willingness of a good number of women to throw other women under the bus , onto the train tracks , down mine shafts . They need their treats ( male approval ) and will dance like lapdogs until they get them . Also , narcissists . They are special unlike other women .
@marca y las feminazis ni palabraque lastima de " periodismo "
People who think there can be a thing called " feminism " , but also that no female experience or issue can be exclusively " women's " because " men " have it too , and vice versa - it just doesn't make sense to me . Not being disingenuous , I just straight up don't get it .
@awaken_to_maga @JessicaOutLoud #Feminism isn't really about #equality , as Jessica has shown . It's about dominance backed by 1960s scientific and geopolitical theories that have long since been destroyed , as well as blind-sheep brainwashing by #TheMachine .
Traditional feminism is NOT empowering . This shallow , safe zone , rejection of feminism is so niave and made for harvesting dopamine from boomers.You can ‚Äô t have third wave feminism without first wave . ALL feminism is destructive to the male / female dynamic and society at large .

@sphericaltime @hell_twiter @Orwellisunwell Gender ideology is built on a meaningless word , gender . Gender is built on sex stereotypes , completely a social construct . Sex , on the other hand is biology . Simple scientific facts . They are not to be conflated.People of any either sex can represent however they want . I do .
We know that dangerous transphobia exists . So what is their intention when they not only focus on philosophy , feminism and product design instead , but identify these as * safety * issues ? Patriarchic gender norms teach people to be transphobic , not Julie Bindel and Always Ultra .

I can only ever know my own inner experience & can never compare this to anyone else , does this mean that I have a unique gender or just that I ‚Äô m as complex as everyone else
@skankzila @oscarandjeeves @HoneyBadgerBite I know when you say ‚Äú toxic masculinity , ‚Äù you ‚Äô re not referring to ALL masculinity . But I still take issue with feminist use of the term for several reasons ( brace yourselves for a mountain of text ):
@ClaireShrugged Reminiscent of all the men who say ‚Äú well , I ‚Äô ve never seen any sexism ‚Äù ... yes mate , that ‚Äô s the point , you don ‚Äô t [ want to ] see it because it ‚Äô s not directed at YOU .
@monaeltahawy this is so unreasonable . radical & gender critical feminists are disappointed with you because your thread encapsulates an entirely toothless version of feminism which concedes that ' woman ' is an open-invitation identity and feminist priorities should be diverted to other causes .
@emmazingt_ @Yvnq_C I thought feminists believed MRAs were a backlash against the environment thet had created . The term toxic masculinity was coopted by feminists . So you're responsible for this environment .
The wretched Guardian with their ‚Äú both sides feel unsafe ‚Äù slander of feminists . Where are the feminists who urinated on a trans professor ‚Äô s door , or posted stickers , or made signs saying ‚Äò no trans ‚Äô or anything of that nature ? The intimidation is one way . https://t.co/OFOY0POEIH

@MENDFamilyCourt @JMoncktonSmith First we were witches , then bitches , then feminazi's and now terf's . Same old misogyny in a shiny new dress .
@ItsMeBabyArms @MichaelRosenYes That's a leap.Gender critical feminism isn't homophobic.Seeking to maintain a distinction between the sexes and minimise the impact of gender on society isn't a stance that hates anybody .
@iamtranssexual @robjessel Society has also changedIt may be that a large part of anxiety in past was to do with rigid sexism & homophobia ? Also people more likely to believe that they were alone in their feelings & take longer to find a ' cause ' ? Individual's reporting of depth of feelings is subjective
@IronicaLeigh @Shamar_Ezer @dontbea_prick @XTheIrreverentX @ScottFree1787 @FreckledLiberty @IlhanMN Feminism is derogatory . And you have absolutely zero ground to stand on to make any comments on " high ground " üòÇ
@helpmeimskek @nellepatron @LisaBritton You don ‚Äô t have to . That is the brunt of feminism today in the west . A cult ideology using false statistics to blame men for ‚Äò women ‚Äô s problems ‚Äô . It ‚Äô s a sexist mindset that has worked its way into universities , k - 12 and businesses . Most women aren ‚Äô t feminists either .
@gal_lawyer @AnnaRadfem In many cases , yes . Countries which embrace self ID and other trans policies often have appalling records of homophobia and misogyny . Others , like Denmark , are rapidly back-pedalling as they realise , for example , that mixed-sex prisons are DISASTROUS for women .

It feels so gross and wrong to deny women their autonomy and sexualization as only ever negative to their image and only for male gratification . Bisexuals and lesbians don't matter to the notion and a woman choosing to be the way they want to be is somehow misogyny or sexism .

@PradzWorLd the word " bitch " is not misogynist , even when clearly used politically and pejoratively - if used by a woman . It becomes a deadly sign of male chauvinistic " pigs " if uttered in similar context by men .
Everything third wave feminism does today makes absolute sense in the context of revenge for the oppression of the patriarchy in the past.Yes , women used to have less freedoms and rights.Now that women have more power than men , they should not abuse it but use it responsibly .

@mollydot Penises are used as weapons against women & girls . Women have every reason to be hyper-vigilant about people who have them . This concept is so basic to feminism , many people decided to stop thinking about it . Now you can claim women who care about sexual violence are " obsessed "

@beaster27 @HowardB20 I heard some feminists say that Rey suffering violence teaches boys & men that it's ok to beat girls and women and glorifies violence . So , no . A person with a hollow heart can never be filled by the external world .

@Michael_AW77 @MForstater I have to admit I haven ‚Äô t read the whole thread . It is disappointing , unit not surprising , so many feminists I had respect for have gone the way of the gender agenda .
@TWProgress This you need to think about . " Perhaps a longer term goal of trans activists and radical feminists should be to continue to advance what they have in common by loosening the rigid cultural ties between gender expression and sex . "
They are both the manifestation of modern day feminism , even the aspirations of it's adherents . But only one of the two is true empowerment https://t.co/o16aqkaT7Z

@ElCatrinCLD @aukletqd @Breaking911 @Fauxmantic How about we ask key people who shaped feminism ? Beauvoir helped create gender theory & influenced feminism quite a bit .

@kelly_mattk That is a whole different story . But just to say that men who are wet and weak and call themselves feminists do have a tendency to be violent towards women when they don ‚Äô t get their way .
That being said , some programs that include self-defense have been more successful . But here's the key : the programs also need to offer accurate facts about sexual violence and pair it with feminist empowerment .
Chela never take stand against owner for any wrongdoings.Sidharth corrected Paras when gender equality is questioned by him.Asim did not question atleast once for wrongdoings of Rashmi . Its clear who is CHELA . #PowerOfSid corrects friends mistakes .
@iamcwill Agree . You know , 60 years ago , the black marriage and wedlock-birthed rate was more than 70 % . What changed this ? Loss of jobs ( for blacks , mostly black males ) , feminism , drugs ( heroin , PCP / sherm , crack cocaine , etc ) , etc .

Feminists blame toxic masculinity to explain why so many men kill themselves . They blame the victims instead of blaming themselves for constantly belittling , judging and putting down men . The never consider their poor behaviors and attitudes toward men to be part of the problem .
If you fight for equality , then fight for all individuals regardless of gender . If feminism is about equality ... Why have a name that relates to only one group ? Seems pretty redundant - unless you don't want equality , you want to be the oppressor .
@jimgeraghty Well , I can believe it . Oftentimes leftist men claim to be " feminists " but it's only to get access to " easy " women or votes . In the end , they don't care . You can tell by how they treat non-leftist women . Still , Fauxcahantos is a liar so I really don't believe her at all .

@weaponsofmassco @trashinfluenced @lacroicsz My take : gender harm is sex based misogyny that males utilize in order to silence and oppress women and girls . Gender role stereotypes are used against females .

@Yvnq_C @emmazingt_ I see it differently . Women have been undervalued in the workplace . Which is good That is now changing rapidly . However men are still undervalued as fathers .

Where are the ' feminists ' ? Western feminism is a lie ? https://t.co/4uP5prSHQX
You're standing for lies , delusion , and danger to women and trans people . In any case , you'll definitely consider this also as the tweets of a transphobe . But you are no feminist in solidarity with women , if this is how you choose to act when you disagree WITH other feminists

@pamelaonearth @TheStage @EquityMEM Its exactly as that , liberals and their " hate speech " laws , which are nothing other than Liberal Blasthemy Laws . You will be legally prevented from challenging liberal ideas , such as LGBT , feminism , multiculturalism , etc .. If youre not a liberal , you will be deemed evil .
@chet_ubetchaa Is it that same study that only studied guys from one social group who all played soccer together and went to classes together and came to the conclusion that suddenly men liked bromances more than women therefore it was misogyny ?

@HeatherHabsburg @phendetta sike ! radical feminism was Correct all along
@Firebird_psych Conflict Tactic Scale was in the mind of the feminists meant to go into more detail of male IPV but when the answers came out nearly equal they disowned it . The purpose was never to find the full story but was to blame men and when it didn't do that it was no longer important .

@lizyeld @d1rrtt Any man that does fight back is immediately called misogynist , women hater . Men have been bred like dogs to defer to women . The 40 % that didn't were excluded by women from the gene pool . Women fucked this up , women should fix this . That's why I support people like yourself .

Hey @womensmarch thanks to your president , female unemployment is at an all time low . There ‚Äô s more women in the work force than men . Trump has appointed more women as advisors and cabinet officials than any other GOP POTUS before him . Misogynist my foot .

Dear Feminists , Abortion does not empower women .
... and other fundamentalist Muslim men is that * they * don't feel any need to apply those layers of sanitisation . Instead , they draw upon the misogyny as written , as Mohammed preached it , as writers of the later legends ( Hadith etc . ) depicted it . So , those apologetics don't apply .

I find it denigrating for the feminist movement on how the Trans Movement can downplay the entire Femininity to just Vagina , Boobs and mere feelings / claims.So bad for them . Sadly i can't root for the gender more than they can root for themselves .
If an employer had to pay a man one dollar for thesame work a woman could do for 59 cents , whywould anyone hire a man ! ? The wage Gap is the biggest scam ever . #Feminism

@poppybravado @LyonStipsen @FaithNaff Don't appropriate the struggle of PoC for equal rights to bolster your desire to call women names . Gender is a poisonous trap of stereotypes to control women . Gender is not something to make laws about , it should no longer even be a thing .

So this is what it's come down to - you're not allowed to reject an ideology , at least if it's devised by a woman of color , because to do so is inherently racist and misogynist.And if you're a WOC who does this , you're just " upholding white supremacy " . > https://t.co/0l56xMOEgD

' Exclusionary ' is woke code for ' unkind ' . But feminism excludes men . Black Lives Matter is not about white people . And trans is not a sexual orientation - and it is legitimate to reassert a distinction based on specific concepts and needs which require clear articulation .

@mahgull_shah Well like I've already said numerous times already , every woman faces these problems . I'm not a feminist so I'm not gonna dismiss women's problems just like that . All I'm saying is these things haven't made women bitter and angry . Only feminists .
@DuffyEricka @monaeltahawy Being born w the potential to produce ova & gestate a pregnancy ( even if in practice your body cant or you choose not to ) is the material state of being female . Ignoring the fact that society treats males and females differently ( & unfairly ) is no kind of feminism i recognise .

I'm not trying to undermine their efforts , but I do think feminists ( esp . mainstream ) often fall short on their discussions of women's beauty practices , which is ultimately unhelpful & harmful to many women .

@ripx4nutmeg @underhandrea You can ‚Äô t identify outside the binary . You can dress & behave in a gender non conforming manner & that may alter where people place you in their perception of gender.They/them is utterly meaningless because everyone balances masculine / feminine stereotypes differently .
I think feminists have such huge contempt for women that lead conservative lifestyles because they see their choices as ‚Äò voluntary enslavement ‚Äô and ‚Äò going back to the oppressive patriarchy ‚Äô . They instantly assume that traditional structures will lead to abuse & imprisonment . üíî
few things make my blood boil more than capitalist women like @ewarren weaponizing identity to gain sympathy & throwing the whole fight against misogyny under the bus , reducing it to your own selfish interest while billions of women out there see their abusers walk free

@ZubyMusic Because feminism has ignored men ‚Äô s victimization and implied that women have it worse even as studies have found men to be half of DV victims and half of rape victims . They are 75 % of suicide and assault victims . They are left behind in our school systems and genitally mutilated

@KirsteinRummery @JoanMcAlpine @theSNP There ‚Äô s nothing feminist abt Sturgeon other than she keeps telling us she is one .

When I spoke at the Sara Project in HoC alongside @YvetteCooperMP @lucianaberger @margarethodge ... Mr Bercow spoke to us about the horrors of unchecked misogyny & antisemitism that was appearing under Corbyns leadership . So for him to say he never saw ANY OF IT ... is not true .
@arunbothra Exact gender Equality is never possible.Gender equitability is possible.Such concepts were already discussed in ancient India , experimented upon and failed.It created more social tensions rather than resolve issues.Let the natural growth of men and women be encouraged .

@whtesde @monaeltahawy I was remarking on her dismissal of transphobes and not specifically the woman in that tweet . She has a flurry of tweets decrying transphobes . Take a look at the post the quote tweeted woman commented on . It was a link to an op ed by Sophie Lewis that mocked Uk feminists .
@alisonphipps It was very clever of the patriarchy to say that issues such as whether everyone has a gendered brain , or whether sex is material and a vector for discrimination , only affect trans people , not women , and therefore feminists may not discuss them

@pickwick @c_kennaugh @OwenJones84 false equivalence in that women are not a privileged group in the way men are - especially when it comes to being the subject of violence . You can only take your point seriously if you don ‚Äô t think sexism actually exists in a meaningful capacity .
@AnimeCentrist @TrilllizardVEVO THAT is a good reason . " sexism " that probably wasnt really sexism is not.but no seriously yes , some jokes jist NEED to be adjusted or they wont be funny cause language
@UnkarPluttVEVO @pickwick @c_kennaugh @OwenJones84 I don't think that ' cis people ' as comprising men and women can be considered a coherent privileged group as women are oppressed by gender too - in a way that men aren't . You can't argue that women are somehow privileged for being born female while also taking sexism seriously .
@IReportYourHate @xmjones100 @Kierkeg45146723 @lilianniee And you can not see the deference between a ideology ( feminism ) and people ( MRA's ) ? Or do you just like smearing a whole group with out evidence ? Oh wait you are a feminist ... Never mind of course you do !

@JamesWHarrison @wullsg @AllianceLGB Nope , untrue.You however , should remember that Lesbian and Bisexual women are as much a part of the LGBTQI movement as everyone else.Everyone should be equal , no group is more important than the other and you are currently being a massive fucking misogynist .
@SarahTheHaider How do you tell liberals who support gender & LGBT equality consistently apart from anti-Muslim bigots who use this to bash all Muslims ? We're the ones distinguishing between liberal & illiberal Muslims , opposing anti-Muslim bigots & objecting to Christian sexism & homophobia too

Not sure who is in more pain ( real and / or perceived ) and therefore can't see through their ideological lens ... MGTOWs or Feminists .
As Martin Luther King Jr . noted , ‚Äú change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability , but comes through continuous struggle . ‚Äù It is vital to ignore the fatigue and continue to pitch the battle of our lives - the racism , misogyny , hate , lies , and corruption cannot stand https://t.co/CmN8HLHvB3
It's frankly dehumanizing to see that so many people think of women not as a full & equal & distinct class of human beings but as mash-ups of sexist gender stereotypes and exchangeable body parts . This s ‚Äã trikes me as deeply misogynistic and dismissive of women's realities .

Reasons I don't support feminism : 1 . It ‚Äô s a mental illness 2 . It ‚Äô s rooted in resentment and hate 3 . It promotes degeneracy 4 . It breaks down families 5 . It makes women ugly 6 . It ‚Äô s pro baby murder 7 . Happy feminists don ‚Äô t exist
This is great for the people . It's only a matter of time , and I hope Iran can recapture it's country and return to what it once was . Any feminists would have a hard time defending what the mullahs have done there.https :/ / t.co/z0skODjpLY https://t.co/P3r2PciqBa https://t.co/zDx4lOYeDx
Strong women want opportunities and a fair fight.Weak women want feminism and gender privileges .
@ItsMeBabyArms @MichaelRosenYes I am a life-long leftie and feminist . I campaigned against section 28 , and knowing my daughter lives in a ( Scottish ) world where she can love as she wills delights me . But the dismissal of women's perspectives by some Trans activists is horrifying .
@dontbea_prick @KristanHawkins @scragsma70 @StudentsforLife A definition is not a ‚Äú who ‚Äù but we can table that for now . Can we agree on this definition of feminism ? ‚Äú the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes . ‚Äù
Feminists don't practice equality , they practice gender favoritism .

A feminist can't bring herself to just say , " Stealing is wrong " because the thief was a woman & the victim a man . So " it's complicated " .

@sallykohn I see zero tweets from you western ' feminists ' praising the #IranProtests . Telling .
The concept that gender is actually innate and therefore women who don't identify as Trans don't have any reason to have any issue with gender / roles / expectations is one of the most toxic . What do they even think feminism is FOR if not in part to dismantle gendered expectations ?

@galluslass @BelleSanders_ I entirely agree.Personally I believe that much of the solution is in gender critical thinking and abolishing gender roles and stereotypes . If my biology doesnt dictate who I can be then I cant have a " wrong " gender identity . 1/2

Good Morning ! Thought of the day : ‚Äú the transition from patriarchy to feminism means women are no longer told what they should wear by fat old men . Instead they ‚Äô re told what to wear by the ugliest women ‚Äù
@ErnestBax Feminists can scream all they like . Others are now carrying the flame .
@Swayamsiddha9 @arunbothra Bcz they themselves wear the consequences , not women . Feminism is ensuring rights to women but de-assuring duties , duties r still on mens shoulder . Even feminism doesn't teach women to be responsible for own actions , modern feminism is rights centric not responsiblecentric

Please , before you drag Feminist Twitter into any silly tweet , note that there are a lot of Misandrists posing as Feminists who have zero idea what Feminism is truly about . A true feminist is never toxic or bitter .
1 ) If it was not for feminism , I would not have the right to vote , to work , to get an education , to have property or a bank account or even to wear pants . Marital rape was legal until 1979 . Feminists changed that . They fought for women ‚Äô s right to say no .

This means that women are coercively assigned a gender identity , although gender stereotypes are the external mechanism of female oppression . This has to be naturalised , otherwise transwomen and women cannot be the same class of person . So women are automatically stereotyped .
It happened during the corporate backlash against Feminism in the eighties . The political movement for the liberation of women , Feminism , was rebranded and marketed to girls as a fashion statement in the style of the " You've come a long way , baby " slim cigarette ads . https://t.co/4WQSz7BBET

I wrote " benefits " because women , deep down , still want commitment + marriage . But it's not cool , hip , or empowered to forsake casual sex to settle down . So feminists will claim they love having casual sex , even though they cry when their Tinder " date " doesn't text back .

Let me be clear : I'm NOT a feminist . I hate feminism.This silly man vs woman war tying society in knots ? Well count me out . I believe that human beings should be nice to each other whether they be male , female or hermaphrodite . I was raised by a strong woman-we just get on with it

If feminists cared at all about the sorry state of men ‚Äô s mental health and the sky-high suicide numbers , they would be judging men by their greatest accomplishments , not constantly berating them for their worst mistakes.No - one believes shaming women is a path to social harmony .

@PolitiBunny Feminists .

@labourlewis That is a bit opaque . Are you a former misogynist apologising to women ? That would make a pleasant change .
@lilithxrmx @kilgefin @monaeltahawy You've totally missed the point . What we are saying is that all of us should be able to express ourselves as we wish . Feminists have always challenged socially constructed gender differentials and stereotypes and that frees up all humans not just a few who label themselves NB .
@Matthew71925909 It's a name I did not invent . Jim suggested " American black feminists " and this seems better although it is still not clear that this refers to Americans who have been there for generations & have ancestors who were slaves rather than any American who happens to be black .
@p3h4j7 @HoneyBadgerBite @PedantDog Meanwhile , the article I posted showing that Indian feminists fought to prevent men from having the same protection as women under rape law stands unchallenged - so it IS true that Indian feminists want it to be legal for women to rape men .

Feminism promotes hedonism through its rejection of personal responsibility , which leads to a sense of meaninglessness . To cure this feeling , they recommend momentary pleasures , like sex , instead of advocating for what really works , taking on responsibilities for yourself .

@StephenKing I'm a woman artist . I may have challenges but when I get there I sure want my work to be judged on it's quality . To do any less would be sexism and I would hate it .
A woke feminist friend who got hitched in Oct doesn't wear mangalsutra on her neck unless she's in Indian attire . She wears it around her wrist.Now the feminist inside her demands the same from her husband . Seems like " bracelet mangal-sutra " is the new trend.Poor husbands . üòê

@Verenami1 Aufkl√§rung ist super wichtig . Mein Punkt war , dass wir jedesmal wenn wir dem Kind sagen " das ist gef√§hrlich weil du ein M√§dchen bist , sei vorsichtig bei fremden M√§nner " , lernen Frauen sind Opfer , M√§nner sind T√§ter & Sex ist m√§nnlich & schlecht .

' Exclusionary ' is woke code for ' unkind ' . But feminism excludes men . Black Lives Matter is not about white people .

@SortofSalient third wave feminists are a cancer
@vonny_bravo @murdo_fraser It is not benign , as it collapses the notion of ‚Äò gender ‚Äô into ‚Äò personality ‚Äô rather than seeing it for what it is ; a culturally shaped set of stereotypes that is so specific to time and place that it is practically meaningless to individuals within a broader existential frame .
@TranssexualOut @NewgentTGA 2/2 Since very few people conform to gender roles and stereotypes then to some extend you could argue that pretty much everyone is non binary being that they dont exclusively conform to one set if gender roles or another .

@ArizonaAngel200 @IReportYourHate @xmjones100 So requesting any kind of legal equivalence for protection of parental / reproductive rights is " whinny " ? Good to know what feminists think about men .

Part of my silence was honestly due to fear . I was living in San Francisco , the most " progressive " city in America , where people live & breathe radical feminism . I was terrified in the beginning to speak up against this idiotic ideology . But 2019 I finally started speaking out .
@Finn_Mackay @MForstater Seems to me this is a major mistake ; the idea that to define someone's sex means that also defines the way they should live , love , & act is fundamentally opposed to feminist thought.Females exist , do the majority of reproductive labor , but are not inferior to males .
@saintlennybruce I see you've greased the goalposts , moving from discussion of the Selective Service , to commentary about France.That ' s a sure sign that you have no interest in good faith . I mean , beyond the original sign - that you think " the patriarchy " described by feminism is real .
Stupidity like this always just ends up making it harder for us to talk about actual Imperialist feminism . ( What kind of feminism talks about women being jealous of men ? Just a roundabout way of saying women dont get boundaries . ) https://t.co/xgMRsFzHxn
@ElleSmithereen Well , apart from certain sections of the left raging because they've nothing to be oppressed about , but yes . I am ; though , still having problems with certain aspects of feminism that I'm crash learning about atm .
@gracelord My criticism of feminism here is far from being ' simplistic ' . I'd imagine that post-feminism far MORE women are hooking up with men who don't adore them . Feminism makes men's behaviour far worse in many ways ... It's large scale social and economic programming .
@taraannosaur @jamesfbrophy well , over here , the people who did the most fighting for Irish women were gender-critical feminists . Everyone else was too busy trying to get pink lego removed from toy shops and tellking women not to " centre " their vaginas .

@JohnDavisJDLLM Would two deaf men who did the same thing have gotten off so easily ? Silly question . Of course not ! Yet , feminists still whine that women are oppressed by The Patriarchy .
If opportunities were denied to women throughout history because of their sex , and also to lots of other people for other reasons , I believe we can coherently criticize the sexism without ignoring or overlooking all the other unfairnesses .

Can I just say that feminism isn't about you and how you feel but about women as a class . The all about you stance is actually neo-liberalism . Also If ( a ) or ( b ) hasn't happened to / or impacted you as an individual , that doesn't mean there isn't a structural / general problem .
And of course , some feminists who are also African American are liberal feminists , radical feminists , Islamic feminists , Marxist feminists and more so even " African American feminism " is not ideal to describe the intersectional / matrix of oppression feminism .

@emmahn6 @MirnaGuha @monaeltahawy you are shadow boxing . The transphobia exists in your strange thoughts . we feminists have supported transfolk since 70s . But gender is generally regressive .

@RJDWWECWCW @dpakman I am not the one who complains about people making fun of other people's clothes . You also fail to mention that it is mostly women , who make fun of what other women wear .

@Oneiorosgrip Feminists : " Such a small percentage of rape accusations end in a conviction ! This is proof that the criminal justice system is flawed !

Many see #RedPill discussion of women in the #Manosphere as #misogyny . The exploration and understanding of #Gynocentrism , #Hypergamy , #Hypoagency etc scares them so it's framed as hate.This is because they hate what is seen and rather than improve on themselves , project on men .

8/ n In the USA of the mid 19th century , the phrase " the isms " was used as a collective derogatory term to lump together the radical social reform movements of the day ( such as slavery abolitionism , feminism , alcohol prohibitionism , Fourierism , pacifism , early socialism , etc ) .

The goal of modern feminism isn't equality . It's to bring down a society they think prioritize men too much . That's why they devalue men and consider their masculinity toxic , and put down women who don't consider men the enemy.All because they are bitter , jealous , and hateful .

Tiring and boring to have to work so hard for someone to believe your experience . If you point out racism ( or sexism ) you are aggressively shut down . So this is helpful . Just note it . Observe it . https://t.co/49K4w6RelM

I hope the efforts to save #AnneWithAnE works . Such a great show that hits so many important topics , some unknown in history such as the horrible acts against Indian families in assimilation schools , feminism , racism , the list goes on . Such a great show !
@ArielleScarcell Yeah , in the gay mens community we have two loud polar opposites . We have the super masculine guys who dislike anything camp or feminine and on the other side the Gender Queer that says anything not masculine makes a gay man not a man . Gender stereotypes are a part of homophobia .
@PaulPfj @NoToMisogyny easy . i was exposed to sexism and standards for women on social media , by strangers , and by my peers ‚Äî starting from babyhood . it drove me to believe that if i ‚Äô m not willing to fulfill these stereotypes and roles and that i ‚Äô m drawn to have things the easy way , i must be a man .
@moviegeek2020 @CodeLaure @coachblade does you not being a rapist forbid me from not wanting any contact with my sexual abuser ? that's the question you don't answer . bc feminism is not what you said it is . btw if that hurts you , sorry , but you don't know feminism .

So two women can't discuss things that materially affect female ppl ? Liberal feminism seems to be working brilliantly - it's obvious such important topics must be left to male women . ' Cis ' women can still be involved in the debate though , perhaps by rustling up some sandwiches ?

@hangontoyrself @jeancampbell11 @MirnaGuha @monaeltahawy What baffling attitude ? That women's rights matter and that feminism should centre those born female ?

@andrewklavan And the feminist war on feminity is hatred of God ‚Äô s purposes and designs for our sexuality . Feminists war against femininity because they have made an idol of masculine power . When they realize they ‚Äô re not able to be masculine , they tear it down , leveling sexuality to androgyny .
The world treats racism , homophobia , transphobia and sexism as problems it ‚Äô s targets should be expectant of and gracefully endure.Speaking up about the many ways our lives are devalued as a result , is so jarring and unwelcome to the privileged . How dare you be honest .

Which is true , partially . Of course there are male victims . Of course there are perpetrators from every background . Of course Tommy Robinson has his own agenda and is no friend to feminists .
The feminist narrative that says that women are victims that kill their babies by abortion is still keeping it going strong . The " march for Life " is a celebration of life , but we are surrounded with all the death and blood of the babies . There should NOT be any celebration
Feminism is toxic . But an idea on the Right that a proper woman must be perpetually 20 years old while sitting in a wheat field making babies ( while not gaining weight ) is also silly . https://t.co/OLKNCpc0VY

@DoubleO87334113 @koojababy @BadFilmTakes A common argument from folks who claim a piece of media is sexist against women when it is pointed out to them that there were women involved , is that their portrayal ( or lack thereof ) of women was only due to " internalized misogyny " , as if they were brainwashed into making it .
Major goals of #feminism : 1 ) Get men to give up power by engaging their natural sympathy for women . 2 ) Keep said power and use it to benift women alone . #Patriarchy theory came about because #Feminists want to grab power and #Privlege for women , and so assume men do it too .

@grain99806254 @JenniferAnne_s @JetSkiBum01 @MatterStill @GoodLifeFitness Yes . Biology ( male / female , boy / man , girl / woman ) exists . Gender ( masculine / feminine ) is another word for " sexist stereotypes " and is 100 % socially constructed . So someone who is a transwoman is a man who wants to apply feminine sexist stereotypes to himself . He's still not a woman

@katiequixotic @Tiktaalik12 @quellist1 The bit you are missing - And an essential bit - is that the stereotypes are associated with the sexes . You need to recognise the sexes as a material reality for gender you make sense . You appear to struggle to avoid this association .
@soorpnakha @vcomon @GadhviLaxman Also Feminists saying " Men Are Thrash " and " Cancel Men " is FOS also MRAs calling " Feminism is Cancer " is their FOS .
I'm a feminist . Yes I am . I believe we're all feminists if we believe in equality . Those who believe in superiority aren't feminists . They're feminazis .

@indiaknight The cause of racism / sexism is prejudice , prejudice formed from stereotyping / generalising negatively about a defined group . Those ' woke ' folk who loudly proclaim to be against this discrimination , lazily then stereotype British people , especially ' white ' people . Flawed thinking .
@AgressiveProgr1 @commondreams @caitoz Sexism ? Oh it's apt . I never realized how sexist leftist men were until I had to work with them in person regularly . They were always pointing fingers at conservatives for doing things they themselves do . Like lady shushing . That was always an amusing if more minor example .
@andylassner @jk_rowling Another white dude speaks . And lies . Trans ‚Äò folks ‚Äô are the safest group in any western country . By FAR .

@grumpysteve47 Yes , it shows that they use the words ' racism ' and ' sexism ' as weapons to attack white men , rather than protecting anyone else .
@LittleMy2020 @Parameterise @GeoffMiethe @Judith_Char But the patriarchy doesn ‚Äô t exist . And feminism proves it .
@maryloubethune Both statements are true.Feminists see the world differently from everyone , including women who are not feminists , and that view is based on lies and half truths.Are you suggesting all white men think exactly the same ? Because that would be racist and sexist .
@theFuriousSJW @hollymathnerd It ‚Äô s so depressing to see anti feminists showing misogynistic contempt for women while wanting equality for men . Their narratives are just as bad as feminist narratives . I ‚Äô m an egalitarian for a reason .
@Flannelberry @bitchy_sushi @TakedownMRAs Pretty much every argument Feminists use is rooted in Toxic Femininity . They're often so busy being mad at men they missed the whole divide and conquer strategy being used by ' woke ' Middle Class ' progressives ' .

Genuinely despise discourse surrounding masc lesbians bc so much about the discussion on their so called misogyny is a thinly veiled excuse to bash on them for deviating from gender norms and expectations that they perform femininity
It keeps their business running . To expand it further , they ' intersect ' it with other issues . Feminists use the LW , Men's Rights Activists use the RW . In reality , they are just giving birth to gender wars . And because of their stupidity , the real purpose gets derided . https://t.co/PnTKCLHYrr
Liberals and feminists are likely to target bully conservative women , despite their belief on gender equality , they do this because they still know women are the weaker sex.They target women , wives , mothers , and even children . They are hypocrites .
@SzMarsupial @celticgoddess51 Because under the Equality Act our protected rights are defined in law as same SEX oriented . Replace SEX with an ill-defined and fluid notion of gender identity and you undermine those rights

@RogdFamily @growinThroughIt To diminish them , then ? I almost never hear it used like how I do against lesbians / feminists / anyone who doesn't center men , esp in straight culture . I only seem to hear lesbians mention it , and usually with restraint .
Magnificent thread . If only @monaeltahawy would listen . https://t.co/3nlwvpA7Eg
@Kaby_bby @jimpachi98 lol feminists generally criticize men more than women so it makes perfect sense that they would criticize transwomen more than transmen . Perfectly consistent through a sex-based lens .
‚Äú Bernie talks with his hands and points sometimes , therefore he ‚Äô s a misogynist who doesn ‚Äô t believe a woman can be president ‚Äù This is the biggest smooth brain take ever seen on television . https://t.co/P33DOLIoz9
@StuckHell Exactly right . First wave feminism served a real function and those women paved the way for us to live our lives freely . But today's feminism is pathetic . And yes , transgenderism is officially recognized in medical field as a mental illness .
@lambdawon @sapphotruther @Kate_Bunni @blairanderson35 @OranMorGlasgow @AllianceLGB Which is wrong . But doesn ‚Äô t make it ok for you to abuse women because they don ‚Äô t agree with you . I ‚Äô ve reported your TERF tweeting by the way , I see this is how you deal with women . Misogynist .

@Daphne_488 @AssNotClass @coachgregadams Yes that's me . Feminism advocates for the rights of women and women only . It is sexist by very definition at the core of the ideology . You simply can't dispose of the sexism without disposing of the label , even if you want to .
@BettyDavisKnees I fear for the LGB community too . The loudest and most voracious voices are those of the religious and political far right . There are GC voices within LGB groups and feminist groups but these voices are being lost because they are at the centre of two extremes .
Instead of helping the UAE government build its veneer of ' gender equality ' you should have helped Jane fight her killer in court . Your deafening silence helped him . https://t.co/315sE2MTGE
Abortion cannot be a human right . Here is just 1 reason why.It only applies to women . If a man decided he didn't want his unborn child and in secret induced abortion in the mother , even radical feminists would be rightfully pissed . However , they want that right for woman alone .

Feminists support women only spaces because being male is the single best indicator of whether or not a stranger is likely to be dangerous . Approx 99 % of sexual violence perps are male , 90 % of victims female . How does @joswinson not know this intuitively ... ? https://t.co/rtptv8mYi3
@LilithLovett dont tell her femdom exists - Id love to hear what fake ass feminists have to say about that kinkXD
@The_Mighty_S @MillerMattu @BBCPhilipSim It always amazes me that we have to ptotect tw ( who are male ) from other men but it ‚Äô s ok for women to have no protection from men as their single sex spaces are colonised . Misogyny writ large .
What if feminism was actually invented by The Patriarchy ‚Ñ¢ to increase the tax base , drive down wages , sow distrust between the sexes , expand governmental control , and make women less happy by encouraging them to eschew feminine values and behave more like men ? ü§î
Dems in WA State pushing mandatory gender equality in the boardroom . In 2018 the same Dems scrubbed gender from parenthood law.So women are critical in business , but not in family ? Dems wrecked the only institution , marriage , that got gender equality exactly right .

@ElCoso8 @WorldOfOrdinary @haywardgallery All the toilets at Edin Fringe were rebranded this way .

Great job .
Useful thread on the #whiteprivilege debate . The way it's conducted alienates potential allies . Demanding uncritical acceptance of dogmas ; labelling and cancelling people who disagree ; answering questions with reading lists . Then restoring to no-platforming and Twitter pile ons .
@LilithLovett According to feminists , men are born with the original sin of penis . They must constantly flagellate themselves to atone for their sins . Religion without the redemption arc .
Why are GC feminists so antagonist to each other ? We don ‚Äô t have to agree 100 % on everything , but can we please stick together on the one issue that affects all women ? Which is man calling themselves women invading female spaces .
It's sad how most people on the left today are unable to see past a person's skin colour or gender . Their cries of racism & sexism are always a projection of their own failed characters . They are racist & sexist so they expect everyone else to be as well which isn't the case .

@saikounabouken Gender critical means opposition to being defined by gender stereotypes . So it is pro-non-conformity in that sense . We are all gender non-conformists to some extent because stereotypes are in the eye of the beholder and it is impossible to conform to all the stereotypes at once .
@JHolmsted ironic that feminists fight so hard for abortion when it enables evil men to evade responsibility .

@SallyAnneBurri1 @DogeInCharge @HoneyBadgerBite Where is the objectivity in standing by action which ( unintentionally ) supports or enables violence ? #Feminism is very good at hiding women's violence against men . Reporting with the hope of deletion supports that ideology and furthers that brutality you claim to oppose .
@leighgt @creepingsharia @BurgerKing @KFC_UKI @panasonic It's crazy . People allow this to flourish . An anti-freedom , misogynist , anti - other religions , Arab supremacist , blood / death cult our ancestors have been fighting since it's inception .

Anyone out here have any tips how to stay positive when the news is so negative for the state of affairs in Canada ? We are being taken over by radical third wave feminists , LBTQ + trans agenda , anti - race activists who do not seem to believe in meritocracy .
This unique animal behaviour is believed to be the precursor to " Some " male feminists characteristics . They are mostly beta males who can't get laid for being weak males ... so they turn allies and act like they get the women just to get close enough to fuck em ! üòÅ üö∂
@EvolvesGod @HappiJason @Oneiorosgrip @weathagirl @Judith_Char @ede9034 @HoneyBadgerBite I quoted the studies , which show women are treated far more leniently than men by the criminal justice system.The feminist wanted to talk examples , so I showed her some of them too.In every case , she excused & justified women getting off with no jail time for serious crimes .
@MeanestBone @hoursfromadness From there , the stupid flows to social work , sociology , psych , etc . Researchers tend to be cautious and careful , and assume good faith .

@jessphillips Labour's transactivists are even purging the women who are rejoining the party . You need to put a stop to Labour's misogyny .
@vrijomslachtig @ardyforshort @skogskant @Docstockk But the social role ‚Äú man ‚Äù does not define what a man actually is . This is what feminists call ‚Äú biological essentialism ‚Äù ; the belief that the gender roles proceed naturally from sexed bodies , that the gender stereotypes in our culture are in fact essences of man and woman .

@GoodWor30133155 @pinkhedonist With feminists it tends to be absolute control , rather than absolute equality.It ' s mostly women refusing to accept feminism that tends to shift the mind set of the feminists.Feminists will usually refuse to accept a male opposing view , but will watch what other women do .
@charlieatempo @SuperDaveInMN @Shpoaphfff @TakedownMRAs I know what feminism is . I used to be a feminist . I read feminist books , feminist articles , listened to feminist speeches , watched feminist YouTube videos and interviews with feminists .

when you think about it , traps are pretty amazing and fascinating . a man can be just as if not more beautiful and attractive than a woman.and a woman can be as boyish and handsome as a man.they break the boundaries of gender stereotypes if we're being honest . https://t.co/c2SlxEdg7r

@LittleMy2020 @GaiaRiot @GeoffMiethe Our notions of feminism comes from talking to feminists .
I keep seeing " believe women " tweets from feminists in regards to Elisabeth Warren's pretty likely made up story about Bernie Sanders . Every " believe women " feminist are the same people who claimed the allegations about Hillary Clinton's husband of rape " didn't matter " in 2016 .
@bitchy_sushi I think the time feminists use to complain about MRAs could better be used to talk to actual suicide survivors and trying to help them out . Assuming of course , you feminists actually care about suicide victims and aren ‚Äô t just using them to prove you ‚Äô re better than MRAs .
The current feminists pressurising a system which convicts a man of HSA / SA with neither evidence nor corroboration and on testimony of one accuser must know this .

Traditionally men fought the the monsters and women reminded them to glance away from the abyss , to enjoy beauty , babies , flowers , and clean warm socks . Then feminists dove into the abyss and now we have trannies .
@SpawnerTrans @SocialNomadRach Live as their gender ? How do you live as a woman as opposed to a man ? Conformity to sex stereotypes ?
@WaveyDavey1602 @GaiaRiot this is what misogyny looks like ... possibly .
Modern feminists hate themselves
Feminists paint all men as rapists . MRAs paint all women as false rape accusers . One and the same . Both have lost all sense of judgement and perceive everything from the lens of the gender they pretend to be fighting for . Justice loses here .

@bitchy_sushi If we want to honestly discuss gender equality , we need to invite all voices to the table . Yet , this is not what is happening . Men ‚Äô s groups are continually vilified , falsely referred to as hate groups , and their voices are systematically silenced .
@piersmorgan @LozzaFox @bbcquestiontime Well that shut her up ! ! ! Superb . This is a prime example of the tactics employed by these idiots nowadays - if they don ‚Äô t like what they hear , they fire out a quick and mild accusation of sexism , racism or any other relevant ‚Äò ism ‚Äô to try nd support their view . Not this time .
@RainbowSquidInk And this is why you don't mindlessly say rad feminists things . You can easily get kicked in the teeth .
@BerJen @AllianceLGB And our feminism does include trans . Trans men , who were born female . Feminism ... By women for women , not for men . That's just how it is

@MichaelGLFlood There's nothing wrong with opposing liars and cheats.Feminism demonizes men like Nazis did to Jews , and slave owners with slaves : * Inspire fear via myths such as " rape culture " and " women are oppressed " * inflame anger & rage * strip rights , eg due process and child access

Okay internalized misogyny aside , how many girls who " weren't like other girls " ended up just being gay or transgender ?
@Momma_Mama2019 @JG92653683 The reality is , the " community " is full of extremely vicious and irresponsible people . They think life is a big gay party . I have experienced much racism , sexism , hate and abuse in the community . They are very phony and fake .
@Unicorn4Change That's first wave feminism . Modern third wave feminism is not equality . It's replacing men in power with women in power .
Siri , show me a tweet that exemplifies internalised misogyny .

@whtesde @monaeltahawy Take your own advice ... She was yammering on about " transphobes " with a focus on UK feminists . Women who do evil things like oppose the housing of male rapists in women's prisons . She can't counter them so she slanders them .
@WMurphyLaw @WomensLibFront testified against it . " The gender identity provisions of the Equality Act will forbid the law to see sex while legitimizing sex stereotypes , & by doing so , they will destroy the law ‚Äô s ability to fight sexism , or protect women from male harassment and violence .

@monaeltahawy The problem with liberal feminism is that they think it ‚Äô s a fun party that needs to invite everyone , not a political movement for the liberation of girls and women .
I just don ‚Äô t get how some feminists can celebrate the suffragettes doing some actually quite violent stuff and then be all ‚Äú to the fainting couch ! ‚Äù when some women get gobby online . One can ‚Äô t help but feel that middle class rank-pulling is more important than solidarity to them .

@patriotmckenzie @JS_Carberry Shaming my gender expression . Nice . But not unexpected from feminists .
Despite referencing the Equality Act this article refers to gender throughout . @BBCNews it's sex not gender .
With that out of the way , let's look at the misogyny those fundamentalists and abusers can draw upon , which shapes their worldview and how they regard girls and women . To begin with , let's consider the general attitude of the Quran to women . The book names a lot of men . Some ...
@tes @tiktok_uk @HughesHaili Gender . Tell children that male or female they don't need to be confined by cultural gender stereotypes . Done .
Radical feminists : Grown little girls that scream for attention by acting like professional victims , using weak minded men to protect them while ironically man bashing . Those that claim to defend women , but will attack women and abuse and rape victims for not agreeing with them .
@Bananaluloop @PetuniaCatLand I agree with you . One could argue that drag was born from misogyny . Women were not allowed to perform . Men played their parts .

@LozzaFox @Femi_Sorry For what it is worth Mr Fox , thought you were excellent on QT . A breath of fresh air , spot on about racism & reverse sexism . A leader should be chosen for their policies , honesty integrity and ability ... not sex or race . It ‚Äô s not right wing , it ‚Äô s just talking sense !
Pretty much everyone who freaks out about " TERFs " thinks that men are entitled , that our society needlessly genders things , and that women are not naturally subordinate . But those are literally the only presuppositions necessary for the radical feminist analysis to make sense !
@Roseav No . I think being told that you are capitulating to a men's rights movement when your whole persona is based around being a mighty fearless feminist , is a bitter pill to swallow .

@largetornado2 @Cernovich I agree . No matter which side you are on . It is a fact that men are not treated equal . Yet feminists want to tell us they are the oppressed ones .

@FourthHailMary @ananavarro Yes . If you ‚Äô re a Democrat , anything you say is woke & brave . If you ‚Äô re a Republican , you are a racist . And , oh boy , if discussing anything related to a woman in any conceivable way , you are also a misogynist . Also if you ‚Äô re a Rep man , when you speak it is ‚Äú mansplaining . ‚Äù Got it ?
@Tekla_alkeT @anti_fembot Feminists have opened up roles only for themselves , and if men benefit its mostly by accident . Notable feminists have resisted equal parental pay for men , child custody for men , and shared parenting after divorce . If men work to secure more options , its not thanks to feminism .
@MForstater @Finn_Mackay @elletorrito @Erythrina5 Quite . The fact that men and women live symbiotically , reproducing together as different sexes of the same species , rather than being different species who can survive apart is a key feature of feminism .

@Tekla_alkeT @anti_fembot I would go so far as to say feminism occasionally pays lip service to men having more choice ( part of its rhetorical promotion ) , and that it has indeed * inadvertently * made male choice more possible .

@RMFAN329 @eccentrikhat I don ‚Äô t hold up equity as a virtue .

@IHasERER @GrumpyCatterman tldr at what point is feminism considerable as a hate group , on as near objective a level as possibleI think their rhetoric about men and society is a bit too similar to antisemites views on jews .
@JuliaHB1 @FJEB88 Because the perpetrators are not white . The feminists in the West only dislike white people . As soon as the misogynists are Muslims or brown people , their virtue signalling role kicks in and they melt away .

@Britestoan @RLong_Bailey It is you who is confusing sex and gender . Sex is biology , male or female . Gender is sexist stereotypes attributed to the sexes . It's something we should be fighting against .

@FunnyPolitical2 @Obsolesence Every time I see new video of the protesters outside of these feminist meetings , I'm reminded of the worst of the abortion clinic protests I saw in the 80 ' s . Like the rabid anti-abortionists , they keep escalating . A trans activist has already murdered two lesbians and their son .
In their coverage of #Meghan & Harry's decision to step back , the UK media has largely failed to hold any discussion of the role of systemic #racism & #sexism in this story , or of the ways they intersect . This article does a good job of addressing that : https://t.co/oaWi0UwyeI

" But if you replace every use of ' female ' with ' feminine ' , the claim begins to make sense . No one conforms entirely to gender stereotypes , no man is as macho as he might have you believe , nobody can entirely escape the charge of being a ' sissy ' . Chu is so close , and yet so far .

@itsjillgardner @WomensInstitute The only way to live " full time as a woman " is to be female , unless you associate " woman " with sexist stereotypes & the ' gender identity ' of some men . So is the WI female only but for some reason you don't feel you can say that @WomensInstitute , or do you actually admit men ?
@monaeltahawy Females should have the absolute right to keep males out of the places & organizations we have created for our specific needs . Feminism is one such place . We may invite you in but you are not entitled to be invited .
Uncle , do not be deceived , that Aunty is no " feminist " , & barely has any idea what " feminism " is all about . She is as misguided as the other Aunties who hate on other women for not being a part of their warped reasoning.Let ' s treat ourselves as humans first , before gender !

@ralirali @joandjackwooll1 @WEBDT08031907 Women's existence viewed as a threat to transgenderism goes a long way toward explaining why trans activists are lobbying to roll back women's rights and using the traditional misogynist tactics to remove women from history and from the language we use to describe ourselves .

@czarevna_panda @JimJatras @Jay_D007 @therealMedWhite @JoeTM_SA @matushkasmomcat Feminists say the same thing about Christianity in parroting the rhetoric of their radical feminist teachers ; that it is " patriarchal " and " oppressive " and demeans women , that it serves to legitimate systemic inequality and " abuse " .
@mareile_s @TooOld4ThisShyt @BBCFactualPR @stephenfry @BBCOne @NHM_London Nope . You are the one conflating them . Gender is a social construct that consists of sex based stereotypes . Sex is material reality , it refers to physicality that comes with functions and sensations . Gender must be performed in order to be seen . Sex requires no performance .
@bindelj So . In the same way I ask TRA how do you define a woman - can you tell me how to define a feminist ? Just so I can check I am still one .
@AuntyMartin After that display of misogyny , I hope you get terrible nightmares .
When the " patriarchy " ruled , it was deemed unacceptable for men to have power over women . Now that feminism rules society , they deem acceptable for women to rule over men because they are more ethical and progressive than men . Feminism is full of self serving contradictions .
There are plenty of signs that misogynists are even more emboldened right now than even a few years ago . Trump , Bernie , sexist Hollywood , & so many other forces are in full backlash mode against women . This craven slob is happy to come right out & use an age-old misogynist trope .
@SocialM85897394 Privilege women of colour , in the same group of the privileged women of Hollywood . They don ‚Äô t have a clue about real racism or sexism .
@SarahTheHaider @PornPanic The problem with Intersectional Feminism , is it seeks to treat traditional feminists in the same manner they have treated men .

@shamanflow Great , now that we've cleared this up . Every other Democrat out there believes a woman is anyone who says they are a woman . Actual feminists know that sex is what patriarchal oppression is built on , gender reinforces that oppression and transgenderism reinforces gender .
@pinkhedonist To be fair . Male feminists are being shamed using the same toolbox .
Hadn't thought of this before but the original tweet raises important feminist issues : Due to evolution , men's bodies have lower fat % and are on average taller & more muscular than women's . It's unrealistic & cruel to set up men's surgically altered bodies as ideal for women .
@AlasdairSampso1 @PankhurstEM @OranMorGlasgow @AllianceLGB ... demands are similar . When GC people point out the differences they get accused of being right wing bigots not dissimilar to those who fight against gay rights . So emotional blackmail get used to great effect sometimes . But GC feminists are having non of it .

The right platform us because they agree that gender ideology is bad news , but for different reasons . How do feminists sound the alarm about transing of kids , prisons etc ?

I don't see any " feminists " talking about this .

Modern feminism has created generations of the most miserable , angry , discontent and unattractive women in history . Women are sold lies about what makes them worthy and beautiful . But a beautiful woman is one who isn ‚Äô t afraid to encompass the uniqueness He created her for .
How sad to see a former idol of mine , Naomi Wolf , engage in pointlessly destructive anti-feminist virtue signalling ( & being unable to recognise a troll account ) . Greer spoke truth from a female perspective . We need more like her , not careerist fauxfems . https://t.co/NZFWryyVCF

@monaeltahawy @Glinner How patronising to suggest that gender critical women need a man to lead them . How patronising to suggest that women could only have an opinion if a man is telling them to . Not very feminist of you . Men supporting women is not the same as men leading women .

@hatpinwoman This is why I was trying to ( perhaps clumsily ) question that drag queen yesterday & find out if he had a far right agenda . He half defended the Proud Boys , so I was suspicious . My fear is that feminists don't BG check voices in the debate & unwittingly do the work of the right .
@Finn_Mackay @elletorrito @MForstater @Erythrina5 Regardless of stereotypes , the fact that only women have the ability to get pregnant and give birth has profound implications on their lives . If feminism were to focus only on stereotypes , this would not help those women dealing with the physical reality of sex-based oppression .

@jesswana It seems to me , part of this discussion was about being gender critical , but now you've reframed the whole thing into feminism . Even worse , you're using the because I'm not black , I can't speak about race or because I'm not female , I can't speak about feminism .

Feminism , like socialism , is a victim bases ideology . They ‚Äô re useless , unhappy and lazy people who refuse to take care of themselfs . This is why they took over popular culture . So everyone can be just as useless . Want to ‚Äú fight ‚Äù it ? Start being usefull . To yourself .

That she needs to ‚Äú gob off ‚Äù about this , the day after the GMP revelations about CSA , shows a SPECTACULAR lack of judgement . And this nonsense made up word ‚Äú Islamophobia ‚Äù , has created exactly the conditions , that stopped our authorities calling out EXTREME cultural misogyny / abuse
@WaveyDavey1602 @GaiaRiot well misogyny seems to be used at any slight inconvenience , so it's meaning seems to be " a person who has a question about possible inequality at an inconvenient moment " from what i can tell .
As a gay man I must say , drag should be nowhere anywhere near children . It is dangerous and sexual and dirty and adult . Drag Queen Story Time in Libraries are the height of stupidity .

@gnomon I know that in this scenario and on this topic you are a misogynist . If you think that biological men should be able to take over women ‚Äô s conversations and spaces even though women are uncomfortable with that then you are a misogynist .

@SBCisonfire @MichaelRosenYes Don't hold back with your ill informed , bigoted , misogynistic opinions about working class , black , disabled and lesbian feminists , will you . Just another bunch of men telling women what to do and how to think . You can't change sex . Keep men out of vulnerable women's spaces .

@Firebird_psych No doubt some dozens or even hundreds of Jews did commit serious crimes in Germany in the 1930s . This did not justify the crimes the Nazis committed against all Jews . The crimes of a few men in rare cases do not justify the crimes of Fascist-feminists against all men and women .

@NikkiStix55 @guardian Feminists can't cope with the blazingly obvious implications of #GroomingGangs so they need to deflect attention from the dubious culture of the abusers .

@gal_lawyer @AnnaRadfem Dismissing a global epidemic of male violence against females ( yes , including trans identified males ) is extremely ignorant & misogynist . Shows no empathy 4 women at all .

@iBeliev25619035 @VictimPrincess @RaquelJ70935397 @whosaidthat2019 @dferguson02 I think you ( and your 40 other screen names ) are a sick freak.You ' re a misogynist , and you mock sexual assault survivors . Yet you seem to claim to be a Christian ( ? ) in some of your accounts - you're anything but . Unlike you , I don't spend every waking moment stalking others .
Different type of content , but with the same effect . Across the board , the organizing principle of popular " feminists " writing is that women need to be more sexually available to men and on men's terms . https://t.co/w8I8SqnW93
@RMFAN329 @eccentrikhat Feminism ‚Äô s double standards aren ‚Äô t equality of opportunity .

Even the woke can't be THIS stupid right ? That slogan was about rape and sexual assault survivors who are routinely disbelieved and treated with skepticism , not some kind of blanket wisdom .

@_Cuddlefish_ @emmahn6 @Mason134211f @monaeltahawy Yeah , seems media often presents so called " terfs " as angry mobs who hate trans women , but gender critical feminists I know just want some common sense protections for women & girls and the ability to discuss existence of biological sex & when it matters like sports , prisons etc
@LisaBritton It's only controversial because society has tilted so far and accepted two insane ( and contradictory ) ideas : 1 ) gender is a social construct 2 ) males are defective females because they are bot the same as females.Basically #feminist theory is arrogant , bigoted , and hypocritical
@tealou @monaeltahawy yes , she has been very rude . Feminists have spent lifetimes trying to give ALL women a voice . She is using the tools of patriarchy to try to SHAME and SILENCE women she doesnt agree with . So , IMO , shes no feminist .
What can we learn from this ? Individual women might want to ‚Äú pick the right husband ‚Äù , as argued by successful Swedish politician @birgittaohlsson . At the macro-level , gender equality in the labor market will be hard to achieve without gender equality in couple formation . 10/10

@caganerx @biminco @xynthia23 @monaeltahawy @naomirwolf Nope . She was going on and on after Germaine had made her point . It was like a cult inquisition . Why are feminists being asked about MEN all the time when there are so many urgent issues affecting WOMEN ?
@JacopoBambino @Obsolesence No one has ... traditional feminism is women who debate and the debate would get heated at times but no one was no platformed or personally attacked .

Another reason why feminists are so bitter : They get to be men . And they find out it ‚Äô s not what it ‚Äô s cracked up to be But instead of admitting they were wrong , they double down
@genwilliams @monaeltahawy Please , gaslight much ? Most I know support trans people & are not suggesting transwomen do not suffer discrimination , but females are oppressed because of their biology & feminism focuses on that structural inequality .

@SilveryCurls Opposing feminism is not equivalent to denigrating women . IMO , feminism is a corrupt ideology claiming female moral superiority and male toxicity . I oppose it every chance I get . That may seem like an anti-female stance , but I do not believe it is ; I wish the best for both sexes .

@marx1sm I do not believe I have ever perpetuated such a narrative , but may I use an analogy ? As a young male I had hurt feelz that feminists wanted to exclude me from certain spaces , or saw me as a potential rapist , because I didn't . They rightly feared my male body , not my identity .

Btw , now ( ( ( bolshevik feminists ) ) ) agitate against white women . After committing GogMagog between white men and women . Destroying white life .

@jammach I think failed discussions between GC feminists & trans activists are often due almost entirely to each side refusing to acknowledge how the other side is defining its terms & arguing as tho they are defining them the way they themselves do . So it doesn't work .

Well , of course he did . Bernie doesn't think a woman has the mentality to be President because we're too busy fantasizing about being raped by 3 men at the same time . Isn't that right Bernie ? At least that's what you wrote in your little essay . Misogynist . https://t.co/aomgzXR9Go
Feminists think you're hateful if you disagree with being called a misogynist for not agreeing that men's welfare should be sacrificed for women's interests.But it's totally ok for feminist men to target nonfeminist women with social aggression for disagreeing with them . https://t.co/4oxV5wLoAU
Why are you so worried about what other women do with their vaginas ? Seriously hetero girls are weird . They spend a lot of time thinking about other women ‚Äô s bodies . Feminist telling you never to shave and then this other kind . What about let me do what I want with my pussy ?
@LisaBritton Woman who lives non-traditional values marries into the most traditional enclave possible . Becomes victim . Feminism .

@MeanestBone @jenkenz69 @antisectional @hoursfromadness I don't know specifically about feminists ' involvement in the the sheds , but the typical approach is : * men create something for men * a few women petition for access * women start putting in rules for their comfort * more women join * women dictate rules

@NotableDesister As Linda Bellos said any disagreement between two women should not detract from the issues in hand . The death of this movement it does not make . One of the things most 2nd wave feminists like myself know is that disagreement is good but name-calling is pathetic .
@_Kenziepuff Lolbertarians have more in common with feminists than they want to admit .
9 / She said that we should wait for representitives of that culture to speak up , b / c after all , the west is also guilty of misogyny . It just isn't enshrined in Sharia Law . No biggie . Ofcourse what she's failing to acknowledge is how decisively Sharia law silences dissidents .

There's no verse which says , " Women , tell your men to get their shit together ... " Again , this speaks to the general tone , the overall atmosphere of sexism and misogyny which liberal Muslims explain away but fundamentalists embrace .
@Rafael69267028 @PhilosophyExp Because as soon as men move in they take over . The whole point is that it allows women to be free from male control . Even the nicest men are a problem in that women behave differently around them . The most feminist thing a man can do is respect women's need to be away from men .
If you value women's rights but put down the idea of men's rights , you aren't for equality . Valuing one gender over the other is the opposite of equality . The only people who think women aren't equal to men are feminists who tend to profit from this belief .

Dear straight male college-aged feminists , save yourself the time of trying to lecture a gay man pushing 40 on " expectations of masculinity . " You don't know shit . I was told I'd become a pedophile & die of AIDS on national fucking TV growing up . A single gender was not to blame .

@HeySunnyRay @TheLondonHughes Same for women ; you're born with less privileges than man by that standard and I agree with both - but not all females go through sexism and not all ethnicity's other than whites go through racism . I understand they're more likely to go through that though .

@Ultranut_ Feminism needs to actually go back to its roots and be about actual equality . Putting someone beneath you because of their gender is not equality , and thinking you're better than someone because of your gender also isn't equality .
@Daphne_488 @AssNotClass @coachgregadams Fixing " Toxic Masculinity " is nothing more than a way to control male behaviour and shame men into behaving the way Feminists want them to .

@Finn_Mackay @HorribleHiking @MuirDragonne @_oatc_ Isn ‚Äô t this the root of the discord ? Conservatives : gender derives from sex , women are inherently less than . Feminists : gender does not derive from sex , it ‚Äô s a set of stereotypes . Trans activists : gender does not derive from sex , but is still innate , immutable and trumps sex .
Women mock men for their shortcomings all the time and it's considered normal , but when it happens the other way around it suddenly becomes " misogynist " " sexist " and " hateful " Why can't women be criticized for their bad behavior ?
If the goal of feminism is to create equality among the genders and within our society , then attacking men cannot be the most effective way to become recognized as equals.And by saying ‚Äò MEN ARE TRASH ‚Äô , you aren ‚Äô t exactly portraying the right step of feminism !

@simon_brooke @MhairiHunter @LMacfarlane1978 @sunrayswench @SNPChris @Sinead1988 It really isn't . Hair colour is naturally various . Sex is a binary .

@cailleachbride @Annndreeaaa @sexisrealXX Well , we're screwed on a lot of things , but the good news is that peeps on the right oppose this because it's LGBT , so if we can get enough peeps on the left to realize this is anti-woman then we can push it back.Too bad those shitheads tied LGB equality to gender identity .

The actual fuck.Parents should not aim " to prevent sexual assault , but to make it less harmful if it does happen . " For Feminists , Empowerment comes at any cost . https://t.co/ExflmwCYVp
@dlmckevitt @SojournerEurope @JamesDelingpole But that's correct though isn't it ? Weaponised womanhood , aka radical feminism , is deeply unattractive - to blokes and wider society . There I've said .
@ColorsTV @BeingSalmanKhan @justvoot @Vivo_India @BeingSalmanKhan is so miffed by dis girl ! He is so irritated by dis psychotic behaviour by her ! And he also cleared shukla dat dis video is not taken well by dese pseudo feminists who want to take footage from ur name ! So be careful with dis psychotic girl ! Great advice !
@monaeltahawy I just do not recognise her as how she is being described . We need to find better ways to disagree within feminist community . I agree with a lot of ideas from both radical and liberal feminism but the wider GC community are becoming really difficult to engage with in good faith .

@NikkiStix55 It's off-the-scale horrendous - the most horrific crimes that could ever happen to women , never mind underage , vulnerable girls and on an industrial scale . And the silence ( where there should be outrage ) from the usually-vociferous feminists and women's-rights groups is deafening

@monaeltahawy You know that is not true Mona . Transwomen are statistically far safer than women . Feminism is about women , not men who want to be women . HTH

@imelda_mairead It's really not my job to defend every woman strangers from the internet happen to disagree with.My point was that a lot of women are quite understandably livid and short tempered after years of gaslighting by some policy-capturing men who play the victim of vile feminists .

@skankzila @oscarandjeeves @HoneyBadgerBite Not that feminists are the only ones who do this , but given how much they claim to hate toxic masculinity , it ‚Äô s odd how much they like to hurl insults that perpetuate it .
People like Indira , Vrinda take part in candle march against crimes but when the time for delivery of Justice arrives , they want mercy for monsters.Rapists are threat to entire humanity . A strict message must to be sent to future potential rapists.Such kinda feminism is toxic ! https://t.co/lz7DwWh4I5
... I would never consider diversity in matters of art . Only quality . It seems to me that to do otherwise would be wrong .
Feminism is a threat to patriarchy so what better way to discredit it in an age of top trumps privilege , rather than intelligent class analysis , than to label it as ' white ' .

@sharrington_k @PinkNews I know , it's difficult to tell really if they support trans rights or if that's just a lucky tie-in with their rampant misogyny .
transwomen deserve to have their own class analysis of why exactly they are being killed and abused in the proportions they are . some do overlap with misogyny but they mean a completely different thing to the market / system , to stop violence against them you must accept this fact .

Autogynephelia - male 2 trans - is a sexual fetish , the objectification of women imposed on yourself as a man . This isn't gender bending . It's solidification of sex stereotypes & a demand we all join in this fetish . We r normalizing this in the guise of civil rights & law reforms

on Twitter : elizabeth Warren is a fucking snakeReal life ( to cute girl at bar ): well yeah I can see where Warren definitely has a point sexism is ingrained in our society
@adamgreeney @irishlovemonkey @patriotmckenzie Why would men take " violence against women is good " from a movie in which a hero brutally kills men who engage in violence against women ? This idea that men protect women from " bad men " is exactly the same dynamic of feminist men protecting women from " bad men . "

@Eva_Biscuit Very true . Maybe @sueatcraven doesn't know that , maybe didn't look for professional work in 1970s . Sexism was rife in Physics .
The campaign that has persuaded large numbers of young people , in particular , that it is progressive to accept that a female brain or soul can inhabit a male body and vice versa is one of the most blatant and most misogynist examples of indoctrination I've seen in my lifetime .
I don't actually agree that feminism doesn't care about sexual violence against women & girls subjected to poverty . I know loads of women working against male sexual violence , for all women & those further marginalised . Campaigning to end sexual violence is core to most feminism .

@Ajctwit @durham_uni @DurhamLawSchool Thanks Alexis - really appreciate your message . Delighted that work on gender equality being recognised !
Feminism was and is being built on the backs of women . Strong women who started talking to each other and comparing experiences , discovering exactly how normal it is to have been treated like you're inferior and alone your entire life . We're not inferior . We're not alone .
Since 2018 we have moved 55 years further away from equal pay . We are not moving faster towards equality but slowing down . Despite common beliefs , equality is not just a matter of time . If we want equality and the removal of the gender wage gap we will need to make be pro active https://t.co/IRi27f4TkG
@FPVaughanIII Believe it or not , there are many feminists fighting back against this kind of stuff ( both pedophilia and transcult ) , myself included . However we cannot do it alone . We need all women and men to stand against it together .

" Pro-trans " is the left's " pro-life " . In both cases an ideology of extreme misogyny is spun as a moral imperative for any decent person , to hide the fact that it exists to remove women's rights . Both are inflexible , and both reject any claims re the competing rights of women .

I just want to give Shami Chakrabarti a hug right now . The panel on #bbcqt is vile and YES , much racism , sexism and misogynoir has blown around the studio tonight ( esp . coming from Laurence - arrogant and hostile as fuck Fox ) . BBC , yet again you disgust me .
When I first found out about the feminists vs transwomen conflict , years ago now , one of the first things I did was read the entire blog of a transwoman . I read everything she ‚Äô d written about the topic for several . It took me probably a month to read it all .
@growinThroughIt @NatashaChart It's certainly well known that loads of gay men despise women . They'll be very quick to let you know it , too . There are those who are decent so I refuse to snap judge anybody , but I've seen more than I want of misogynist gay men .

When I fight the " Men are Trash " agenda I'm not defending myself or my ego , I do not take it as a personal attack . It's me going against the viral mindset that saying this causes a positive impact for feminism when in reality it dirties your slate . Stop killing your cause

@mahgull_shah You asked whether I fear going somewhere alone and I answered . Feminism has fed you many lies and one of them is that men can roam around at 2am in their pyjamas without any fear.Also , every woman faces those problems you stated . Yet majority don't choose bitterness and hatred .
One thing we can be sure isn't happening : Violence against trans people isn't the result of a violently-inclined feminist readership . We have yet to hear of yobs getting drunk , reading @Docstockk or Germaine Greer and going out to beat up crossdressers .

@BelleSanders_ What i advocate for is abolition of gender stereotypes , recognition of transsexualism and appropriate non affirmative medical support with transition onky as a last resort and of course getting rid of the ridicuous transgender umbrella that sees far too many things conflated .
@FlorioGina I made a feminist very angry when I told her that feminism has no place in 2020 because gender is just a social construct ü§£ ü§£

Interestingly , they're preoccupied with demographics . They still have that " will to live " . They're trying to fix it with money ( the romans tried that but failed ); censoring western pop culture and feminists would have a better effect .
By gender they mean sex ( And reading Oxfam's big Davos report it is clear that there are people inside Oxfam who know this . Can the organisation say it out loud ? Being female is a material reality . It is not something you can identify into or out of )
Toxic masculinity is the excuse gays and feminists use when straight men and straight-acting men don ‚Äô t think or act the way gays and feminists want them to .

A TERF is a woman who questions her safety and rights around the new trans activism Ôøº which includes self ID and lots of misogynistic attacks on women . Anybody who calls a woman a TERF is a misogynist . Wake up social justice warriors , it is not progressive to be a misogynist !

If you need more proof that Warren's campaign didn't leak this " Bernie is a sexist " story , look at the virulent sexism all over Twitter tonight . Painting a woman as a liar is a classic misogynist trope , especially when you make her out to be a bitch ~ falsely accusing ~ your hero .

@Bruadar_xx He's protected his account . Presumably because having tried to tag a lot of accounts to incite a pile on to a bar for hosting an LGB event and failing to get back up , he couldn't defend his misogyny & internalised homophobia . No doubt it's our fault .

When a guy comes forward about his mental health issues , or isolation the worst thing you can do is claim they're leveraging it for women's sympathy . Our attention to men's mental health issues is pitiful and reinforces bad stereotypes . That's not " feminist " , it's reactionary .

Why is it that men can ‚Äô t have opinions on abortion because they don ‚Äô t have a uterus , but women can have an opinion on war , combat and national affairs when they can ‚Äô t be drafted ? Is this another special privilege that women are fighting for ? True equality is foreign to feminists .

@Rafael69267028 @TJVRD Because feminism is the radical uprising of women for autonomy , self-determination and liberation from male power.Partly it emerged precisely as a reaction to the male dominated , male serving , counter-culture of the 1960s .
@SarahTheHaider 3 / Then what you see is today ‚Äô s intersectional feminists selecting one of the original axis-points to zero-in & it takes precedence over others .

On page 40 of Catharine MacKinnon's " Feminist Theory of the State , " she says " sexism is a system of subordination to be overthrown . " For her , all heterosexual sex is sexism . The goal of radical / lesbian feminism is to stop sex between men and women . This is pure Lesbian fascism .

Political organisations represent people's political interests.Both gay rights , and feminism , are sex-based interests.The trans rights movement is sex denialist.So when gay rights and feminism is dominated by sex denialism , they can no longer represent our interests .

@BlanchardPhD the idea that female bodies are a consumer good which can be obtained for sexual gratification is rooted in patriarchy . This is pathological misogyny , just like johns , it ‚Äô s just focused on the self rather than other people .

@sillyolyou @MichealConraoi @monaeltahawy @2damntrans Gender is a construct based on stereotypes of behaviour & presentation which are used to prove trans status in children - toys , clothes , games preferences , etc . Sex is dimorphic & immutable , based on reproductive potential ( large or small gametes ) . There is no 3rd sex .
@A_48er @Synthmatrix @IanSMcNee @labourlewis I think it is worth distinguishing between gender ( which can mean all kinds of things - - a chosen identity , a ( presumed ) psychological state , appearance aligned with social stereotypes ( clothing , hairstyles etc ... ) and sex - - male or female , which is a matter of biology .

It is very evident that feminism exclusively respects men with feminine traits.While it ‚Äô s great that we accept everyone - those high in masculinity , assertiveness , ambition & dominance are deemed ‚Äò toxic ‚Äô .
They believe this thing is feminism , as part of what they more broadly call " cultural marxism " ( with varying levels of explicitness to the anti-Semitism they lean on ) , that there is an actual Matriarchy oppressing men .

@EloraEdwards You ‚Äô ve not researched . Uk feminists are overwhelmingly left wing with personal histories of activism . It is the spoilt little students who view themselves as Transactivists . View themselves welcoming of people of colour , disabled - oh unless you are a woman and are disabled or poc
This is the best advice to all , basically .

@Blackyoshi1299 @TheMoominmama @jammach @MaleNiple @SinOfSilence @shane_reaction_ @satiricole @PoloGlasgow @AllianceLGB But as I've already said , it is unscientific . Telling kids they can be born in the wrong body is a faith based belief . They need to be loved , told they do not need to conform to gender stereotypes + supported to understand that being a butch girl or a feminine boy is fine .
I consider myself aligned ( mostly ) w / 2nd wave feminism . I also consider myself not a dogmatic person . If parts of a movement / theory / whatever are proven wrong or I disagree , then I admit it . E . g . I don't think gender is entirely a social construct .

@MaryECostello Indeed . And the summary which popped up with the link said ‚Äú ... while carrying someone else ‚Äô s baby ‚Äù or some such misogynist euphemism . A baby grown inside your body can only ever be your baby , and the true ‚Äò surrogate ‚Äô is the person who takes the baby from you .

@PankhurstEM @Someone81521029 @preta_6 @JammersMinde @libertyhq Lesbian women are canaries in the coalmine of feminism : other ( marginalised ) groups too , but lesbians sounded warnings about what was happening on the fringes of LGBT politics , where the PIE activists also had their feet under the table . 40 years on and history repeats itself .
The idea that women want men who will treat them decently is a sign of how the " sexual economy " has been skewed in women's favor . They can't get 3s because feminism made women believe we're all entitled to a 10 , and that we can just be lesbians if we don't get them .
This is such an important insight . This is why intersectionality frustrates the goals of feminism rather than advancing them . It forces a ‚Äú cultural sensitivity ‚Äù mindset which inevitably favours Patriarchy . Feminism is about tearing the old models down , not preserving them . https://t.co/FBbS8NqYRL

Critical theory was originally a critique of capitalism from the 30s designed to redeem the validity of Marxism in light of its practical failure in the USSR . It gradually decayed into a long-winded , confusing discipline with the aim of making mediocre thinkers sound original .
@Tekla_alkeT @anti_fembot ... you posit feminism as a force fighting for men's increased options . I say it is not ; that it does far more to shut down men's options , notwithstanding of the incidental ones it has opened while seeking increased power for women . Feminism is gynocentrism , not humanism .

@andwal79 If these moderate , rational types of women were to openly speak up against the man hatred & denial of male issues - they could trump the hateful , vengeful feminists . But so far this has not happened on the level it needs to .

@murdo_fraser Thank you . " Assumed gender " suggests one agrees with regressive stereotypes associated with one's sex . So , womanhood is reduced to a liking for heels and lippy.No wonder children are so confused . Their lives are potentially being wrecked by this stupid , sexist ideology .
@_hera_ @Joey77591001 Mainstream , western feminism today isn't about equality , at all.It isn't about anything it claims to be.At one time , long ago , it was honest & real , but those days are long gone.Iranian and Kurdish women are real feminists today.Western feminists , w / few exceptions are frauds .

CONCLUSION : feminism has convinced women education / career is more satisfying than a husband / kids ( a family ) which is very wrong . It's sad that women only realise this when they're past their prime & all they have is medals , books written , money etc
Even within feminist spaces , opinionated women are accused of being mean to men , too aggressive , inflammatory etc . and more often than not these insults are hurled at women of color . There is nothing hateful about women talking about the reality of our lives .

@adamgreeney @patriotmckenzie But feminists don't . They don't associate positive traits with masculinity in the way they associate toxic ones . Thus they coined " toxic masculinity " to gender anti-social behaviours .
@skankzila @oscarandjeeves @HoneyBadgerBite Toxic femininity is never explored as a concept by feminists , even though toxic masculinity is . As far as I know ( and correct me if I ‚Äô m wrong ) , the feminist excuse for this is that when women exhibit toxic behaviors it ‚Äô s because of patriarchy or internalized misogyny .

@MinxGenie @joe606 Fun fact : feminists literally believe that logic , facts and reason are all products of the patriarchy that are oppressive and need to be destroyed . Ya gotta push back against nutty women like me ü§™

I keep wondering why Trans Rights Activists don ‚Äô t focus as much energy on their real enemy - violent , * actually * transphobic men - as they do on berating women whose only ‚Äò crime ‚Äô is to discuss their specific sex based rights ? It ‚Äô s a mystery ! ü§î #misogyny #EasierToBlameWomen

Good to see @GEOgovuk taking steps to challenge #misogyny and #patriarchy in the workplace . The existing normalisation of #SexualHarrasment , both at work and outside it , allows violence against women in every area of life . We must challenge this : https://t.co/YzimdO3OB8 #VAWG
@piersmorgan She only got to be an MP due to an All Women Shortlist . Of course she supports sexism . She is profiting from it .

@MForstater I'm fairly certain that the men who have called you a feminazi are with you on the gender critical thing . You can believe that modern feminism is nuts and dangerous whilst also thinking that the whole transgender thing is also nuts .
I think feminism fails to acknowledge that for a very long time traditional gender roles ensured survival.If both parents went hunting ‚Äò mammoths ‚Äô , the kids would starve or hurt themselves.It ‚Äô s only VERY recent that you can leave a child in daycare & have both parents go work .

@scrumpyh3 You're welcome . Though I'm only a semi ally , I think.It ' d be better not to read the abortion thread on my timeline if you go with the standard feminist line on those matters .
@PhoenixBlack19 @weathagirl @WEP_UK Basically , feminists argue that if the rapist cannot be caught then another innocent man must be placed in the dock and found guilty . That is accepting a rape took place , so often today , a rape can be any number of things , even a 1/2 second brush in a busy tube station .
@JohnDavisJDLLM @MinistryBad Women used to complain the church has taboo's on sex and wanted the clergy out of the bedroom ( who ever listen to the clergy on morality ? , and they replace morality with police , social services , the judicial system , and the prison system , all under the ideology of feminism .
@missdaisyfdoo @amaryllisalpha Why don ‚Äô t you tell me why feminists think TWAW then ? That would save a lot of discussion .

@outrocaraaqui No , that IS gender . Gender and sex used to be closely related but different . Now gender and sex are completely different things . Gender is roles , stereotypes , personality traits , and aesthetics assigned to the sexes by society .

@SilentMelody35 Don't you love games of " Was it a sex-neg feminist , or a religious puritan that said ... " ?
If a man is a " bad boy " , a " cad " and runs around impregnating multiple women and fails to embrace father hood , then he is marginalized by society . If he commits to one woman , serves as " head of household " then he is considered by society a bigot , a misogynist , an evil patriarch .
‚Äú Last year , a review by mental health expert Sir Simon Wessely called for a tougher definition of single-sex accommodation . ‚Äù Exemptions in the Equality Act allow for this .

@internationalm The problem is that the word " #patriarchy " has a couple different meanings.One is legit , used by cultural anthropologists to refer to societies which are patrilineal , patrilocal , etc.The other , spelled with a capital " P , " is the #feminist version , used to lie about society .

@Dauntus You don't liberate women by removing their ' sex based rights ' and replace them with ' sex-based stereotype ' rights . Gender identity is literally just sexist stereotypes and there are lobby groups who wish to replace ' sex ' with this vague notion in law .

@Rational_Quotes @RationalMale The reality is most women fail their own tests . The only reason they're treated as passing is because of rhetorical privilege where feminism has granted them an excuse to say , " I don't like that man , so he's harassing me , " but if a woman offends a man , he's told to deal with it .
